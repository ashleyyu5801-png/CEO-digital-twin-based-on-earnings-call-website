      "question": "Yes, good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence, but Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be -- the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players, given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of the ability of the banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward? And maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that banking -- the banking system should be a source of strength?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Everyone trades stocks in a different way. So, sentiment -- but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too.\n\nAnd I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the next month.\n\nAnd then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you see that.\n\nAnd anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is.\n\nI just also want to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion. And then, to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month -- three-quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stock will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me start by acknowledging the current economic landscape. We're in a period of significant uncertainty, and it's natural for markets to react with sentiment-driven volatility. That said, I firmly believe that the banking system, particularly institutions like JPMorgan Chase, is well-positioned to be a pillar of strength during these times.\n\nHistorically, banks have played a crucial role in supporting economies through downturns, and we're prepared to do so again. Our capital position is robust—our \"capital cup runneth over,\" if you will, with a CET1 ratio at 15.4%. This gives us the flexibility to absorb potential shocks and continue serving our clients effectively.\n\nJeremy's point about the banking system being a source of strength is spot-on. Despite the sentiment in the equity markets, the math, as you put it, supports a different story. We have strong liquidity, a diversified business model, and a disciplined approach to risk management. These attributes enable us to not only withstand economic turbulence but also to support our clients and the broader economy.\n\nIn terms of how this might impact the economy moving forward, we're preparing for various scenarios. Whether it's a mild slowdown or a more pronounced downturn, our focus is on maintaining financial stability, supporting our clients, and investing in opportunities that drive long-term growth. We're not going to sit on our hands—we're proactively managing risks and seizing opportunities to innovate and adapt.\n\nUltimately, while market sentiment can be fickle, our commitment to being prepared for all eventualities ensures that we're capable of weathering storms and emerging stronger. We'll continue to do whatever it takes to uphold our role as a cornerstone of economic resilience.",

      "question": "Okay, got it. And then, just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Just are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then, we have, depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that, but based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment and that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So -- but we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.",
      "generated_answer": "That's a great question. First, let's acknowledge the economic backdrop. We're navigating through a period of macro uncertainty, and it's crucial to maintain a solid capital position. Our capital cup runneth over, which gives us a lot of flexibility. We have a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, so we're well-capitalized to handle whatever comes our way.\n\nNow, in terms of capital deployment, we always prioritize our long-term strategic growth. This means continuing to invest in technology and expanding our client base, which are key for staying competitive, especially with Silicon Valley knocking on the door. We're not going to sit on our hands; innovation and adaptation are crucial.\n\nRegarding buybacks, it's about balance. If our stock is undervalued, that's an opportunity to add value to shareholders. However, we're also mindful of conserving capital to ensure we can weather any economic downturns. We want to be prepared for all eventualities, which is why risk management is always top of mind.\n\nOverall, it's about maintaining a strategic approach, balancing investment in growth areas with shareholder returns, and ensuring we're ready for whatever the economic environment throws at us. We'll do whatever it takes to maintain our leadership position.",

      "question": "Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US treasuries if those reforms are implemented? And just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some of the recent volatility?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. So, SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which has deep flaws in them, to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks. It's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change.\n\nThe reason to change some of these things is so banks -- the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't -- if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea, but every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So, they should make these changes.\n\nThe reason why is when you have very -- lot of volatile markets and very widespread and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks themselves. And anyway -- and we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate the markets, help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no -- basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thanks for the question. As you know, the regulatory landscape is always evolving, and the proposed changes to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) are an important part of that. The treasury's commitment to providing relief under the SLR is a positive step, especially in the face of recent rate volatility. It’s crucial for banks to have the flexibility to manage their balance sheets effectively without being unduly constrained by regulatory capital requirements.\n\nNow, regarding your question about US treasuries, our approach has always been to make prudent investment decisions that align with our overall risk management strategy. While geopolitical concerns and global demand fluctuations can impact the market, our strong capital position—our capital cup runneth over—allows us to be opportunistic when it makes sense. If these SLR reforms are implemented, it could certainly enhance our ability to manage our balance sheet more dynamically, including our treasury holdings.\n\nHolistically, managing rate risk is one of our top priorities. We’re not going to sit on our hands; we're actively using a range of hedging strategies to mitigate the impact of rate volatility across the firm. This includes not only managing our treasury portfolio but also looking at our loan and deposit pricing and durations. The goal is to ensure that we’re prepared for all eventualities, whether rates go up, down, or sideways.\n\nUltimately, our focus remains on serving our clients and maintaining a strong financial foundation. We're going to do whatever it takes to ensure that our risk management practices are robust and that we’re well-positioned to navigate the current economic landscape.",

      "question": "Very good. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads, that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system. And there should be -- and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, first off, it's important to acknowledge that regulatory changes are a constant in our industry, and it's something we are always prepared to adapt to. When it comes to the current administration and the personnel in key regulatory positions, including Treasury Secretary Bessent, I think there's an opportunity for constructive dialogue and collaboration. \n\nI'm confident that they recognize the need for a balanced approach that ensures financial stability without stifling innovation or competitiveness. We are hopeful that the new leadership will consider the practical implications of regulations like the SLR and the G-SIB buffer. It's about finding the right balance, ensuring that banks are well-capitalized and resilient, while also allowing us the flexibility to serve our clients and support economic growth.\n\nWe've always been prepared to do whatever it takes to meet regulatory requirements, and we'll continue to engage with regulators to provide our perspectives. Our capital cup runneth over, so to speak, and we're in a strong position to navigate these changes. Ultimately, it's about ensuring a robust financial system that's equipped to handle whatever comes its way, and I believe that through collaboration, we can achieve that.",

      "analyst": "Ebrahim Poonawala",
      "question": "Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you will have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates? Are the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs, is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all of that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him in the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with -- around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle, they're not going to be -- trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, it's no secret that we're facing a complex macroeconomic environment right now, and there's a lot of noise out there. When I talk to clients and corporate CEOs, the recurring theme is the need for clarity and stability. Businesses thrive on predictability, and the constant shifts in policy—be it tariffs, regulatory changes, or geopolitical tensions—create a lot of uncertainty that makes long-term planning challenging.\n\nNow, a 90-day pause on tariffs is a step in the right direction, but it's more of a temporary relief than a solution. What companies really want is a consistent and clear policy framework. They need to understand the rules of the game so they can make informed decisions about investments, hiring, and growth. Confidence comes from knowing that the environment isn't going to change dramatically overnight.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, I think what would really inject confidence is a strong, pro-business agenda that focuses on sustainable economic growth and innovation. This means addressing not just trade issues, but also looking at infrastructure investment, regulatory simplification, and fostering a business-friendly climate that encourages entrepreneurship and competition.\n\nIn the meantime, Jamie's mantra of \"being prepared for all eventualities\" is more relevant than ever. We have to stay flexible and ready to adapt as conditions evolve. We're not going to sit on our hands—JPMorgan is committed to supporting our clients through these uncertain times, helping them navigate the challenges and seize opportunities as they arise.",

      "analyst": "Ebrahim Poonawala",
      "question": "Got it. And I guess, as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of week. Just your comfort level in terms of the functioning of the treasury market? Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Any color would be great.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you, I don't think that's going to go away and that relates to that. Obviously, the US dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed -- we've been consistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently it happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened, that will happen and then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we don't know if and when that's going to happen and we'll see.\n\nBut the notion that the 10-year treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, we have huge global deficits back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter, tariffs, at least our economists think, will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So, we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",
      "generated_answer": "Alright, let’s dive into this. The recent moves in the treasury markets, with the 10-year yield jumping from 3.99% to 4.50%, certainly catch the eye. Now, volatility like this can be a bit unsettling, but it's not entirely out of the ordinary given the current economic climate and monetary policy shifts.\n\nFirst off, it's important to recognize that the treasury market remains deep and liquid. However, such rapid changes in yields do suggest some underlying concerns, whether they’re about inflation expectations, economic growth prospects, or monetary policy adjustments.\n\nNow, regarding the Fed's potential actions, it's all about balancing their dual mandate: managing inflation and supporting employment. If the treasury market volatility starts to significantly impact financial conditions or economic stability, the Fed might consider adjusting its approach. This could mean pausing quantitative tightening (QT) or even temporarily stepping back into purchasing treasuries. But, as of now, they seem committed to their current path, focusing on data-dependent decisions.\n\nFrom our standpoint at JPMorgan Chase, we're always prepared for these shifts. Our risk management strategies are designed to handle such volatility, ensuring we continue to serve our clients effectively while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're not going to sit on our hands – we’ll adapt as needed to navigate these changes.\n\nIn summary, while the recent movements in the treasury yields are notable, the market remains fundamentally sound. We’ll continue to monitor the situation closely, and if the Fed does decide to adjust its strategy, we'll be ready to respond accordingly.",

      "question": "Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive -- as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "I'll just also say that it may not be deposits, it may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen, which is different, is not the risk-off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.",
      "generated_answer": "Absolutely, let's dive into that. We've indeed seen some interesting movements in deposit trends, particularly given the volatility in the markets. In March and April, we observed an uptick in deposits as corporates and investors sought the safety of cash amidst the market fluctuations. This is a pretty typical response during periods of uncertainty—folks look for stability, and banks like JPMorgan Chase become a natural safe haven.\n\nBut let's not get too carried away. While we saw an increase, it's important to note that the overall deposit growth was moderate compared to previous spikes. The landscape is different now, with interest rates playing a significant role. Some depositors are looking for better yields elsewhere, which is why we're seeing more nuanced behavior in deposit flows.\n\nOur focus, as always, is on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ensuring we're prepared for various economic scenarios. We're not just sitting on our hands here; we're actively managing our deposit base, optimizing our liquidity, and ensuring we can continue to serve our clients effectively, no matter what the market throws our way.\n\nAnd as we look ahead, we'll keep a close eye on macroeconomic conditions and adjust our strategies to ensure we're competitive while maintaining the safety and soundness that our clients expect from us.",

And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Again, almost impossible to answer. We look at all the cycles. We prepare for a full range of outcomes. So, not -- I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold, but I do -- I pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months. So, maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that.\n\nBut it's -- the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down. It looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know. But we are -- I've been quite cautious and you can see it in our capital, liquidity, our position, our balance sheet, and so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thanks for the question. You know, I've seen quite a few cycles in my time, and while each one has its own nuances, there are always some common threads. Right now, we're in a unique situation with a mix of high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions that remind me a bit of the late '70s and early '80s, but with a modern twist due to the digital economy and global interconnectedness.\n\nIf we're talking about a potential slowdown, it might resemble a more traditional economic cooling period where inflationary pressures lead central banks to tighten monetary policy, which in turn could slow down growth. However, unlike past cycles, we have to consider the rapid pace of technological change and the role of big tech and fintech, which are reshaping industries faster than ever before.\n\nWe've also got to factor in the global supply chain dynamics and how they've been disrupted recently. The resilience of these supply chains in the face of potential geopolitical shifts could play a significant role in how this cycle unfolds.\n\nAs always, our approach is to be prepared for all eventualities. We're maintaining a strong balance sheet, focusing on risk management, and continuing to invest in technology and innovation. This way, whether we face a slowdown reminiscent of past cycles or something entirely new, we'll be ready to support our clients and seize growth opportunities.\n\nRemember, our capital cup runneth over, and we're not going to sit on our hands.

      "ground_truth_answer": "So, Betsy, this is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy and please read my Chairman's letter, the most important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for democracy. That is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean, and I -- the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change we've never seen in our lives.",
      "generated_answer": "...let's dive a bit deeper into what these numbers really mean for us and our operations. We've had a solid start to 2025, with strong net income and revenue growth. Our EPS growth of 14% is particularly encouraging and demonstrates that we're executing well on our strategy, despite the challenges in the broader economic landscape.\n\nNow, a few key points to highlight. First, our net interest income is up slightly, which is a good sign given the ongoing rate environment. It's a testament to our team's ability to manage margins effectively even as pressures on deposit rates continue. This is where our diverse revenue streams really pay off, allowing us to maintain strong performance in all conditions.\n\nOn the balance sheet front, we're seeing healthy growth in both loans and deposits, which tells me that our clients are engaged and confident in our services. Our CET1 ratio is rock solid at 15.4%, giving us the flexibility to continue investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders.\n\nLooking at our business segments, the standout performance in our Commercial & Investment Bank with a 21% increase in Markets revenue is worth noting. This reflects the strength of our global platform and our ability to capture opportunities in volatile markets.\n\nBut let's not forget credit quality. While we've seen a slight uptick in allowances for credit losses and nonperforming assets, we're prepared for this. We've been conservative in our provisioning, and our risk management framework is robust.\n\nAs we move forward, our focus remains on strategic growth, particularly through technology investments and expanding our client base. We're not going to sit on our hands. We're going to do whatever it takes to maintain our leadership and adapt to the changing environment. We've got gravel in the gut and spit in the eye, ready to tackle whatever comes our way.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, we're in a strong position. Our capital cup runneth over, and we're prepared for all eventualities. It’s all about staying ahead of the curve and delivering for our clients and shareholders.",

      "question": "Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a \"deep recognition of flaws\" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put -- you or Jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid as much as red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you'd pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation?\n\nBut before that, the negative which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman letter about the trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars \"get over it\" to this week say \"do something.\" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened? And do you really think next earnings call will be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about to \"get over it,\" I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it.\n\nYou may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade. So -- and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of -- obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about \"get over it.\" I did not change my view about it.\n\nI would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too. Maybe the extent they want to do it, they said they're having conversations with 70 or 80 different people. And so, I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system.\n\nAnd I don't -- I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see, okay? There will be thousands -- hundreds of people maybe, but it's not going to be [passed on] (ph), but it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages if it's done right.\n\nI specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing that right now.",
      "generated_answer": "Alright, let's break this down. First off, on the regulatory front, there's a lot to unpack. We recognize there are flaws in the current system. It's crucial that regulations ensure safety and soundness, but they also need to be efficient. The ideal scenario? We keep the core safeguards that protect the financial system but cut down on unnecessary red tape that doesn't add value. This isn't just about reducing expenses; it's about making the whole system more effective and responsive. \n\nIf we streamline processes and reduce bureaucratic overhead, we could see significant expense reductions. These savings could be shared with customers through better rates or more competitive offerings, and some could bolster our investments in innovation. Plus, a more efficient regulatory environment could lower costs for the regulators themselves.\n\nNow, on to trade wars. Initially, I did say \"get over it\" because businesses need to adapt to the realities of global trade dynamics. But, these issues have persisted longer than expected and have become more complex. That's why I'm saying \"do something\" now. We need decisive action to resolve uncertainties. Trade tensions have ripple effects across the economy, and clarity on this front would be a relief for markets and businesses alike.\n\nWill we see resolution by the next earnings call? It's hard to say. Geopolitical issues are unpredictable, but I'm hopeful that progress will be made. We're prepared for whatever comes, and we'll keep adapting as needed. Thanks for the questions.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "If you do all -- if you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%. And the reason for that isn't -- it's not just capital. It is also LCR. It is also G-SIFIs.\n\nAnd the question you should ask, because you are very smart, Mike, is could you -- have the same -- and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to the First Republic of Silicon Valley, and you can accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nYou can read our -- I think our [MPRs] (ph) are public and stuff like that. And so, they should do that, just make a better system. We have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. And if you don't -- I'd say, when you look at these rules and regulations, see Europe. If that's where we want to go, let's just go there.",
      "generated_answer": "Let's break this down. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio is a critical measure of a bank's financial strength. Currently, we're running at a healthy 15.4%, up from 15.0% last year. This demonstrates our strong capital position and our ability to weather economic uncertainties while continuing to serve our clients effectively.\n\nNow, your question about reducing the CET1 ratio to free up capital for additional lending—hypothetically speaking, if we were to adjust the CET1 ratio downward by one-fifth, it could indeed unlock significant lending capacity. However, it's essential to balance this with maintaining a robust safety net to support our operations in various economic conditions. \n\nOur capital cup does runneth over, but we're not in the business of taking unnecessary risks. We're going to do whatever it takes to ensure our resilience and competitive edge. That means being prepared for all eventualities, including potential economic downturns or regulatory changes. \n\nSo, while the idea of extra lending capacity is enticing, we must carefully consider the implications for risk management and long-term stability.

They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international US company during trade wars, and I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers, so how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us, but I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and we'll just have to deal with that.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, I appreciate the question, and you're absolutely right to highlight the complexities of being a global player in today's environment. First off, let me say that we're very proud of our strong first-quarter performance—credit quality, trading, and EPS all reflect our robust business model and strategic focus. But as you've noted, there's a bigger picture when it comes to operating internationally, especially with the current geopolitical climate.\n\nTrade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties are indeed significant risk factors for a company like JPMorgan Chase. However, these are not uncharted waters for us. We've always been prepared for eventualities, whether it's a trade war, regulatory changes, or economic shifts. Our approach is to be vigilant, adaptable, and proactive. We have a strong risk management framework that allows us to navigate these challenges while continuing to serve our clients effectively.\n\nIn terms of partnerships with countries, communities, and customers, we maintain a philosophy of collaboration and communication. We engage with policymakers, participate in dialogues to understand the landscapes we're operating in, and work to ensure that our voice is heard in shaping fair and effective trade policies. Our global presence is supported by local expertise, which helps us manage risks more effectively and seize opportunities as they arise.\n\nAnd let me assure you, we're not going to sit on our hands. We'll continue to invest in our global operations, leveraging our technology and human capital to mitigate risks while focusing on growth. The bottom line is, we're prepared for all eventualities, and we'll do whatever it takes to maintain our leadership and serve our clients around the world.",

      "question": "Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree flawed regulatory system could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are you -- are the systems better? Are they better able to handle it as your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy -- I agree with Jeremy. I'd add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid/ask spreads that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes, so you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps and a whole bunch of different things, treasuries, that's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you're seeing in DCM today, when you don't have bond deals, when you have less trading, when you have -- so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients. So, we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads go up or down and pretty bad.\n\nBut the plumbing of the system, I would say, the plumbing worked well during COVID, too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and it wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had. So -- but you're always worried about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",
      "generated_answer": "Great question, and thanks for bringing this up. Let's dive in.\n\nFirst off, I do believe that our systems and risk management capabilities have significantly improved over the years. We've invested heavily in technology and talent, and it's paying off. Our platform is more diverse, our people are better trained, and our risk management practices are more robust than ever. This has certainly helped us navigate the recent volatility and deliver those strong trading results you mentioned.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all volatility is created equal. While we've been able to capitalize on certain market movements, there's always a level of unpredictability that we have to be prepared for. Our approach is to be ready for all eventualities, which means continuously stress-testing our systems, diversifying our risk exposures, and maintaining a strong capital position—our capital cup runneth over, so to speak.\n\nThe market's plumbing, as you put it, has held up well, but that doesn't mean we can be complacent. Regulatory systems still have room for improvement, and we're actively engaged with regulators to make sure we're all on the same page and can handle future challenges effectively. We're not going to sit on our hands; we'll continue to adapt and innovate to ensure we're prepared for whatever comes our way.\n\nSo, in short, while we've made great strides and are better positioned today, we recognize that the landscape is always changing, and we need to keep evolving. Thanks for the question, and I'm confident that with our strategic focus, we'll continue to manage risks effectively and seize opportunities as they arise.",

      "question": "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess, how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts? If you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn, I think you do have -- in the $95 billion guidance, you do have good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you -- does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments or do you think that's just completely short sighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "As you said management thing, because I think it's very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses, and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off. And -- but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can imagine -- if you go to -- if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail.\n\nAnd so, there is -- we're making a -- I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID, the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the -- and Mike Mayo mentioned the thing about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit.\n\nI mean, we -- I pointed out resolution recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long, okay? It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long, okay? We report 1 trillion -- I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the -- all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we -- that hopefully we can get rid of and reduce the cost of the system and -- but it's not new branches. So, the folks here are working on, we call, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that. So -- and we're having fun doing it. It's like -- to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so -- and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thank you for the question. It's a great point and one that's always top of mind for us. When we look at our cost structure, we always start with the principle of being disciplined and strategic. Our investments in people, branches, technology, and marketing are designed to drive long-term growth and enhance our competitive position. We believe it's crucial to continue investing in these areas to better serve our clients and stay ahead of the curve, especially in today's rapidly evolving financial landscape.\n\nNow, if we were to see a revenue slowdown, our approach wouldn't be to immediately pull back on these investments. Instead, we'd carefully evaluate the economic conditions and our strategic priorities. It's not about making knee-jerk reactions, but rather about being thoughtful and flexible. We always aim to balance short-term efficiency with long-term growth prospects.\n\nHowever, should we encounter a more significant downturn, we would reassess our investments across the board. Our goal is to ensure that we're positioned for resilience and can capture opportunities as the environment stabilizes. We're prepared for all eventualities, and we'll do whatever it takes to maintain our leadership position while being prudent with our resources.\n\nIn the end, it's about serving our clients effectively and ensuring we have the right infrastructure and talent to do so, regardless of market conditions.

      "question": "Jamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to?\n\nAnd secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Chris, just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture, so nothing has happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that.\n\nAnd then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing.\n\nAnd how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for America? And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let's dive right into it. First, regarding the optimism around financial deregulation, I think it's crucial to maintain a healthy dose of realism. Deregulation can definitely provide opportunities, but it's important to remember that the regulatory environment is inherently complex and subject to change. While there might be some favorable shifts, we need to be prepared for all eventualities. So yes, there's optimism, but we're not going to sit on our hands—we'll keep a close eye on developments and adapt as needed to ensure we stay competitive and serve our clients effectively.\n\nNow, on the topic of capital, we're in a strong position. Our capital cup runneth over, so to speak. We're maintaining a CET1 ratio of 15.1%, which gives us flexibility. In terms of deploying capital, we're always looking at a range of options. This includes organic growth, strategic acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. However, any decision will be contingent on macroeconomic conditions and regulatory requirements. We're going to do whatever it takes to maintain our leadership and ensure we're prepared for various economic scenarios.\n\nAs for timing, it's a dynamic landscape. We'll continue to assess the macro and regulatory environment carefully. We're not setting any rigid timelines, but rather focusing on being methodical and strategic in our approach. We'll keep you updated as things evolve, but rest assured, we're committed to making decisions that enhance shareholder value while maintaining our strong financial foundation.",

      "generated_answer": "Sure, happy to dive into that. When it comes to capital allocation, we're always looking at where we can maximize returns for our shareholders while aligning with our strategic priorities. Right now, a few areas stand out.\n\nFirst, our Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) segment remains a key focus. With a 14% increase in client investment assets and a robust ROE of 36%, there's a lot of potential to deepen our relationships with clients and expand our market presence. We'll continue to invest in enhancing our digital capabilities here, making it easier and more efficient for our customers to engage with us.\n\nNext, our Commercial & Investment Bank (CIB) is another area where we see strong opportunities, especially given the 15% increase in markets revenue. This segment is critical as we navigate the competitive landscape, particularly with the fintechs and big techs making their moves. We'll be looking to strengthen our presence in key markets and invest in technology that enhances our trading and advisory capabilities.\n\nLastly, Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) is showing impressive growth with an 18% increase in assets under management. With a high ROE of 36%, it's clear our strategies are resonating well with clients. We'll likely allocate capital here to support further expansion and innovation, ensuring we remain a top choice for clients seeking comprehensive wealth management solutions.\n\nOverall, we'll remain disciplined and proactive in our capital deployment, focusing on areas where we can leverage our strengths and drive long-term growth.

And -- but I do think you have fintech, these guys are very smart. I'm trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts to get the payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved. We're going to be in it and learning a lot and player.",
      "generated_answer": "Absolutely, happy to dive into that. So, stablecoins are definitely a hot topic right now, and for good reason. They're part of this broader wave of digital innovation that's reshaping the financial landscape. As I've mentioned before, Silicon Valley is coming, and stablecoins are a part of that competitive mix. But let's break it down.\n\nFirst, stablecoins offer a lot of potential for efficiency in payments and the broader financial ecosystem. They're designed to provide the benefits of digital currencies—like speed and low transaction costs—while minimizing volatility by being pegged to stable assets, usually fiat currencies. This makes them attractive for various use cases, especially in cross-border transactions and settlements.\n\nNow, how does JPMorgan fit into this picture? We've always been about serving our clients and adapting to market changes. We're not going to sit on our hands while this evolution happens. That's why we've developed the JPM Coin, which is our own stablecoin. It's primarily used for the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional clients. This helps us enhance our service offering by leveraging blockchain technology to deliver speed and efficiency that traditional systems struggle with.\n\nAs for the JPMD deposit token, it's a natural extension of our efforts in the digital space. It's designed to facilitate transactions on the blockchain, providing a secure and efficient means for clients to move funds. This isn't just about competing; it's about enhancing the way we serve our clients and staying ahead of the curve.

But just wanted to understand, does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "So this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer. So we think the customer has the right to, if they want to share their information. What we asked people to do is, what are they -- do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It should be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because somebody of these things going on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so we're kind of in favor of all that done properly.\n\nAnd then the payment, it just -- it costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system protection. So we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it.\n\nThe last thing is a liability shift. I mean I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that.\n\nAnd if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third-party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility in their part. So we can all do a better job for the customer. That's why.",

And you may or may not have seen that Apple is looking at possibly, there's chatter, getting into the AI game more by looking at a company such as Perplexity.\n\nJust thinking out loud here, would it make sense for JPMorgan to consider acquiring an LLM, right?

Artificial Intelligence, especially LLMs, has the potential to transform how we operate and serve our clients. Whether it's enhancing customer service, improving risk management, or driving efficiencies across the board, AI can be a game-changer.\n\nHowever, we have to be thoughtful about where we make our investments. Our focus is on areas that align with our strategic goals and can provide a sustainable competitive advantage.

When we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing, should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out 6, 9, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that we all look at?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "You can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We've built, I think 500 bank of the innovation economy, which is kind of new to us. I think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business, regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next 6 to 9 months.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let's dive into it. First off, the middle market businesses are really the backbone of the U.S. economy, and they're facing a mix of challenges and opportunities right now. Interest rates have been on a bit of a rollercoaster, which affects borrowing costs and the overall financial landscape for these businesses. Tariffs and global trade dynamics are also adding a layer of complexity to their operations, not to mention the impact of slowing consumer spending.\n\nNow, in terms of credit quality, we're always keeping a close eye on it. At JPMorgan, we're prepared for all eventualities, and we have a strong balance sheet to support our clients through these turbulent times.

For instance, businesses that have been able to adapt and innovate, leveraging technology to enhance their operations, are faring better.\n\nLooking ahead 6, 9, 12 months, we do expect some headwinds.

      "question": "Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography?\n\nAnd Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And to answer your other question, Mike. So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second.\n\nSo G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and stuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book.\n\nAnd when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let's dive into those questions.\n\n**Jeremy's Response:**\n\nCommercial loan growth in the second quarter was notably robust, and there are a few reasons behind this. First, we saw increased demand across various sectors as businesses continued to rebound and expand their operations post-pandemic. Specifically, sectors like technology, healthcare, and industrials showed strong borrowing activity. Geographically, we noticed significant strength in regions where economic recovery was more pronounced, such as in certain parts of the U.S. and Asia-Pacific regions. Companies there are gearing up for growth and investing in capital expenditure, which is driving the demand for loans. We also enhanced our client outreach and support services, which helped us capture more opportunities.\n\n**Jamie Dimon's Response:**\n\nAs for the regulatory landscape and encouraging more lending by banks, there are a few things that could be beneficial. The Treasury Secretary's goal of increasing bank lending is commendable, but it requires a delicate balance. Regulators could focus on creating a more predictable regulatory environment, which would help banks plan for the long term without the concern of sudden rule changes. Streamlining some of the more cumbersome compliance requirements could free up resources that banks could then use to increase lending capacity. Additionally, adjusting capital requirements to better reflect the current risk environment could provide banks with more flexibility to extend credit. It's essential, though, that any regulatory changes maintain the stability and safety of the financial system, ensuring we're prepared for all eventualities.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, and I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things can reduce the actual cost of making loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we've just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let's talk about the cost of making a loan and potential streamlining opportunities. When it comes to lending, the costs can include everything from origination and underwriting to servicing and compliance. These costs can add up, but there's always room for improvement and efficiency.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge where we stand. We have a robust loan portfolio, with total loans up to $1.412 trillion. That's a significant operation, and naturally, managing it involves considerable resources. However, we're always looking for ways to optimize our processes.\n\nNow, let's put this into context. Over the years, we've invested heavily in technology and digital platforms, which are crucial in reducing costs and improving efficiency. For example, automation in underwriting and digital loan applications can significantly cut down processing times and reduce manual errors. This not only saves costs but also enhances the customer experience.\n\nLooking ahead, we're not going to sit on our hands. We're continuing to innovate and adapt. Streamlining the loan-making process isn't just about cutting costs; it's about delivering better service and maintaining a competitive edge. Whether it's leveraging AI for risk assessment or enhancing our digital platforms, we're going to do whatever it takes to ensure we're prepared for all eventualities.\n\nAnd let's not forget the human element. Training and upskilling our workforce to work alongside these technologies is another area where we see potential for improvement. It's all about striking the right balance between technology and human expertise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the costs of making a loan are a factor, we're confident that our ongoing strategic initiatives will continue to drive efficiency and value for our clients.

      "question": "Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "In a competitive world, it is irrational to thing that -- and when it applies to all the competitors that everyone is just going to make a lot more money to keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.\n\nAnd Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. Now they should do a low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff, if you didn't do, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns. That we just -- we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches, that does our private bank or things like that.",
      "generated_answer": "Great question. Let's dive into it. \n\nFirst off, it's important to recognize that any simplification in the regulatory environment, especially around Basel III endgame and G-SIB requirements, would indeed have some impact on our return on tangible common equity (ROTCE). Simplifying these constructs could potentially free up capital, giving us more flexibility on how we allocate it, which could be beneficial for our ROTCE.\n\nNow, in terms of optimizing the denominator, yes, there’s an opportunity there. With fewer constraints, we might be able to manage our balance sheet more efficiently, which can help improve our ROTCE. However, it's not as straightforward as just boosting returns. We have to consider the competitive landscape and how changes impact pricing and client relationships.\n\nTo your point about passing benefits back to clients, that's certainly part of the equation. In a competitive market, some of the efficiency gains could indeed translate into better pricing or enhanced services for our clients. At JPMorgan, we're committed to serving our clients effectively, which means any improvements in our cost structure or capital efficiency could enhance our ability to offer competitive products and services.\n\nUltimately, while a simplified regulatory framework could provide some tailwinds to our ROTCE, it's a multifaceted decision. We're constantly balancing shareholder returns with client value and long-term strategic growth. And let's not forget, we still need to maintain robust risk management and a strong capital base to be prepared for all eventualities. So, while we might see some improvement, it's not a straight line, and we'll continue to focus on what drives sustainable value for both our shareholders and clients.",

And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement.\n\nAnd the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly, we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it -- does activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels, or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you might want to -- I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. And so that lesson we've learned over and over, it may stay wide open for 1.5 years. Something may happen geopolitically that all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yes, you're going to have really active markets.\n\nI do think that extending the tax bill for business to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done.\n\nI also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial Liberation Day, now there's more talk as more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed, that reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1.",
      "generated_answer": "You’ve hit on a critical point regarding investor focus. When we talk about EPS gains, it’s not just about the headline numbers. It’s about understanding the underlying dynamics and strategic moves that drive those gains. Improving ROTCE is crucial, yes, but translating that into tangible EPS growth is what ultimately creates shareholder value.\n\nNow, regarding the pickup in activity levels late in the quarter, several factors are at play. First, there's been some relief in removing extreme outcomes from tariff policy and gaining more clarity on the tax front. These developments have certainly helped stabilize the business environment and improve sentiment among our clients. When businesses have a clearer regulatory and tax landscape, they feel more confident in making investments and strategic decisions. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while some uncertainties have been reduced, we're always going to face new challenges and opportunities.

It dictates how much leverage we can take on relative to our capital, and any changes to it affect how we manage our balance sheet.\n\nNow, when regulators talk about reducing the SLR, the idea is to give banks more flexibility to expand their balance sheets, particularly into lower-risk assets. This could, in theory, ease some pressure and allow us to allocate capital more efficiently. However, the dynamics between supply and demand are complex. It's not just a matter of having more room to grow; it's about finding the right opportunities that align with our strategic goals and risk appetite.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, there are indeed opportunities in lower-margin areas, especially if we can optimize our balance sheet without being constrained by the SLR. But we have to be cautious. We can't just chase growth for growth's sake. Our focus remains on serving our clients effectively, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and ensuring we're prepared for any economic twists and turns.\n\nSo, yes, there's potential for growth, but it's about finding the right balance. We want to ensure that any expansion into lower-risk, lower-margin areas still meets our return thresholds and risk management standards. At the end of the day, we're committed to doing what's best for our clients and shareholders, and we'll navigate these regulatory changes with that in mind. We're not going to sit on our hands – we're going to continue adapting and seizing opportunities as they come.",

      "generated_answer": "Sure, let's dive right into it. The recent changes in pricing for our Sapphire cards are part of a broader strategy to stay competitive and continue to deliver value to our customers. We believe that by adjusting our pricing, we can better align with customer expectations and market conditions, while also enhancing the benefits that come with the Sapphire brand.\n\nThe initial response has been positive. Customers appreciate the increased value, particularly given the premium experiences and service that come with the Sapphire cards. We're seeing strong engagement and interest, which is exactly what we aimed for. It’s about ensuring that our offerings remain attractive in a very competitive card market.\n\nStrategically, this move is part of our ongoing effort to maintain our leadership in the card space. We know that fintech and other players are constantly innovating, so we're not going to sit on our hands. We’re proactive, leveraging our scale, brand, and customer insights to offer products that not only meet but exceed market expectations.\n\nIn terms of growth opportunities, this pricing strategy allows us to tap into new customer segments while retaining our existing base. By enhancing the value proposition of our cards, we can drive higher engagement and spending, which ultimately contributes to our growth objectives.

      "ground_truth_answer": "What's the tariff pressure with pressure on loans or debt. The answer is no.\n\nNo, I mean. There's always pressure in some of those.",
      "generated_answer": "You know, it's interesting you bring that up. The competitive landscape, especially with the regional banks, is always something we're keeping a close eye on. As for deposit pricing pressure, it's a reality across the industry. We're certainly seeing some pressure from commercial and corporate customers looking to offset the impacts of tariffs and other economic factors. It's a competitive environment, and we're not going to sit on our hands.\n\nNow, let's put this into context. The regional banks often have a more localized foothold, which can lead to competitive deposit pricing. However, at JPMorgan Chase, we've built a robust and diverse set of services that go beyond just pricing. Our focus remains on providing comprehensive solutions that help our clients navigate these challenges, whether it's through better cash management, innovative financing options, or leveraging our global network.\n\nWe recognize the importance of maintaining strong relationships with our clients, and we're committed to doing whatever it takes to meet their needs. While deposit pricing is one aspect, our approach is to offer value-added services that help our clients grow and manage their businesses effectively.

      "question": "Just two quick follow-ups. On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines. I know we've been here before and markets can give us and take it away. But there is a time value in there, meaning corporates, and more importantly sponsors, need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if that -- if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time? We've been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now. Does it -- is it feel more doable as long as the market doesn't take the rug out from under us?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "I think it separate sponsor-owned companies from IPOs. There are companies going public. They're in the pipeline. They want to go public, et cetera. Sponsors are still, at least from what I can tell, anecdotally still reluctant to use the public markets. There may obviously be maybe more of it, but it hasn't been a mount of stuff coming out.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right—markets have a way of giving and taking away. We've seen this cycle time and again. But here's the thing: there's a significant amount of dry powder out there. Corporates and sponsors are indeed sitting on capital, and they need to put it to work. The urgency to get deals done is palpable. \n\nNow, in terms of confidence, I'd say we're cautiously optimistic. The pipelines are robust, and the demand is there. We're seeing a lot of interest across various sectors, and that's a positive sign. But we also have to be realistic. The market environment can change rapidly, and external factors—whether it's economic data, geopolitical events, or regulatory changes—can impact that momentum.\n\nSo, while it does feel more doable right now, we're prepared for all eventualities. We have to be nimble and ready to adapt if the market shifts. But rest assured, we're not going to sit on our hands. We're committed to supporting our clients and helping them navigate these opportunities as they arise.\n\nIn essence, if the market holds steady, there's a good chance we'll see these pipelines convert into real activity.

      "question": "I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the onetime effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is.\n\nAnd if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was guidance -- guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some onetime -- not onetime items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially -- I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE, which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you can answer this one. I just might add really be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we cannot just earn 17% ROTCE is that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17% you're a bond, then you will trade at 3x tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing.\n\nIf you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers internationally. And when we look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe is it's been great. Innovation economy has been great. We're gaining shares in a lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the international -- payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that is the best way to use it.\n\nYou have all of our major bank competitors are back, rolling and expanding. Then you have the fintech folks, who are quite capable and quite smart, who you don't want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion is that somehow we're not going to deal with tough competitors, right, which protects JPMorgan Chase, if we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on realizing -- you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day.\n\nAnd so we're quite cautious to just declare victory, like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, because I had Jeremy do this number one point, if you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America -- for 40 years maybe.",
      "generated_answer": "You know, that's a great question, and it speaks to the heart of how we view our business and the financial landscape we're navigating today. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge where we are: a 20% ROTCE is indeed strong, and we're proud of that performance. But it's important to understand the context. The 17% target we've set historically is based on a long-term, sustainable model, accounting for potential economic headwinds and varying market conditions. We're not in the business of setting targets that only look good in the short term; we're focused on what's realistic and achievable over the long haul.\n\nNow, has the business inherently become more profitable? In some ways, yes. We've made strategic investments in technology and client services that have enhanced our efficiency and capabilities, contributing to better returns. Our diversified business model allows us to capture opportunities across different market environments, whether it's in consumer banking, investment banking, or asset management.\n\nHowever, there are also tailwinds at play. For example, changes in interest rates can have a significant impact on our net interest income, which, in turn, affects ROTCE. Market conditions, regulatory changes, and the broader economic climate also play roles. So, while these factors have given us a lift, we always remain cautious about relying on them indefinitely.\n\nIn essence, while we're enjoying favorable conditions now, we're not going to base our targets solely on them. We're prepared for all eventualities, and that's why we maintain a conservative target like 17%. It's about being prudent, aligning with our strategic goals, and ensuring we can deliver consistent value to our shareholders no matter what the market throws at us.\n\nRemember, our capital cup runneth over, but we're not going to sit on our hands. We keep pushing forward, innovating, and staying ready for whatever comes next.",

      "question": "If I could get an answer to this from both you, Jeremy, and Jamie, the question really is how much of a risk is the lending to the NDFIs? Just -- I mean, because you guys are always outfront highlighting what could happen, whether it's cyber or as you point, labor market or inflation. And I feel like you haven't really highlighted this as a potential risk area. Maybe that's because you don't perceive it as such, but you have Tricolor, you have First Brands. One area of your biggest growth, I think, has been NDFIs over the last year.\n\nSo I'm just trying to put this in some sort of context that as it relates to Tricolor, who bears the losses? Does end investors in the funds? Is it -- do you put skin in the game and have your own investments? Are you an underwriter? Where are you exposed? So I guess I'm asking JPMorgan specifically but then Jamie more generally for the industry. Is this something that's flashing yellow that you are spending more time on? How should we think about that?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. Mike, I would just add that it's a very large category of nonbank financial institutions and probably a number like half of it, we would consider very traditional, not like different. There is a component, which is different today than it was years ago, and there's a component which isn't that different. But if you look at like COs, CLOs and lending to leveraged entities that are underwritten with leveraged loans, so there's kind of a little bit of double leverage in there.\n\nI would say that, yes, there will be additional risk in that category that we will see when we have a downturn. I expect to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be because we don't know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did. Jeremy said these are very smart players. They know what they're doing. They've been around a long time but they're not all very smart. And we don't even know the standards that other banks underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that some of those standards may not be as good as you think. Hopefully, we are very good, though we make our mistakes, too, obviously.\n\nSo yes, I think you'd be a little bit worse. We've had a benign credit environment for so long that I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate a little bit more than people think when, in fact, there's a downturn. And hopefully, it will be a fairly normal credit cycle. What always happens is something is worse than a normal credit cycle than a normal downturn. So we'll see. But we think we're quite careful. And obviously, we scour the world looking for things that we should be worried about.\n\nBut I do remind people, we've had a bull market for a long time. Asset prices are high, a lot of credit stuff that you would see out there, you will only see when there's a downturn.",
      "generated_answer": "Alright, let's dive into this. Lending to Non-Depository Financial Institutions (NDFIs) is an area we're watching closely, and you're right to point out that it's been a significant growth area. Now, let's get into the nuts and bolts of it.\n\nFirst off, from JPMorgan's perspective, our approach to lending in this space is grounded in robust risk management practices. We're not just handing out money without a thorough understanding of the risks involved. We assess the creditworthiness of these entities meticulously and have a clear framework in place to manage any potential exposures. When it comes to entities like Tricolor or First Brands, we ensure that any lending is backed by strong collateral and that there's a clear understanding of who bears the risk. Typically, end investors in the funds would bear the losses, but we do put some skin in the game to align interests.\n\nNow, speaking more broadly about the industry, NDFIs have been growing, and with that growth comes a need for vigilance. You won't hear me ringing the alarm bells just yet, but it's certainly an area we're keeping an eye on. These institutions can sometimes operate with different regulatory oversights compared to traditional banks, which means we need to be extra careful. It's crucial to ensure there's no excessive risk-taking or leverage building up unnoticed.\n\nWe are also mindful of potential systemic risks. The industry as a whole must ensure that these institutions are resilient, especially in the face of economic headwinds. We're not sitting on our hands here; we're prepared for all eventualities. Our ongoing focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a close watch on these emerging risks.\n\nIn summary, while lending to NDFIs is a growing part of our business, we've got a firm grip on the potential risks. We're confident in our risk management practices and remain committed to serving our clients without compromising on financial stability. It's about smart growth, with one eye on the future and the other on potential challenges.",

And we think we're okay in other stuff. But I -- my antenna goes up when things like that happen. And I probably shouldn't say this but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. And so we should -- everyone should be forewarn on this one. And first brands, I put in the same category. And there are a couple of other ones out that I've seen that I put in similar categories. So -- but we always look at these things, and we're not -- I'm nipping in. We make mistakes, too. So we'll see. There clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things.

When you look at the revenue relative to banking and wealth management, obviously, it's not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be -- when they come out with comments, they follow up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessent has pointed out about a couple of months ago that he thinks there's a housing emergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is, what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the corresponding treasury yield, assuming the treasury yields don't go down. But what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower mortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity, of course, would pick up with that.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "So I'll take that one. First, on the supply side. I mean it's -- we know what it is. It's permitting, it's rules, it's local rules. It's how long it takes to get permits and build not my backyard, you can't build 2 stories in certain places. That's the supply side. The demand side -- and remember, don't always push homeownership. I was -- we made a huge mistake in the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I've been talking about it for years that they should focus on reducing requirements require and we think you reduce the cost of mortgages 30 to 40 basis points overall. without creating any additional risk. There is just excessive stuff put in place after the great financial crisis, which obviously demanded a response but it's excessive. Anyone to take it out a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all these things. So that to me is the most obvious one.\n\nAnd obviously, government policy, if the government wants to do more FHA, they can do that. But that's up to them about where they want to cheap in mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that. But if they did anything like that, I would say, always do it really thoughtfully.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let me tell you, the dynamics of the mortgage market are complex, and addressing the spread between mortgage rates and treasury yields isn't a simple task. But we're not going to sit on our hands here. There are a few things that could be done to make a meaningful impact.\n\nFirst, the government could look at ways to reduce some of the regulatory burdens that add costs to the lending process. Streamlining regulations could lower the cost for lenders, which might translate into lower rates for borrowers. This isn't about cutting corners but finding efficiencies that don't compromise safety and soundness.\n\nSecond, enhancing the liquidity of the mortgage market can help. One way to do this is by ensuring there's strong support for the mortgage-backed securities market, possibly by expanding programs that buy these securities. This would help drive down mortgage rates by increasing demand for these loans.\n\nAlso, there's room for the government to play a role in supporting affordable housing initiatives. Addressing zoning laws and providing subsidies or incentives for building more affordable housing can help alleviate some of the pressures on the market.\n\nIt's also worth considering the role of technology and innovation. Encouraging fintech solutions that streamline mortgage origination and underwriting could help reduce costs and improve efficiency. Silicon Valley is indeed coming, and their innovations could play a pivotal role in reshaping the mortgage landscape.\n\nUltimately, it's about a coordinated effort between policy-makers, financial institutions, and innovators. We need to be prepared for all eventualities and adapt to whatever changes come our way. Whatever it takes, we need to keep finding ways to serve our clients better and support the broader economy.",

Can you guys give us any color of what you're actually seeing on the ground. We're, what, 9 months or so into this new administration with the new regulators? And then also any color on when you think Basel III end game may come out and what you're hearing in terms of how it will compare to what the original proposal was in July of '23.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. And I just add the Dana number, they are doing that. They're looking at it holistically, that's great. But Dana number is right. I've said for years, G-SIB, CCAR, operational risk capital, double counting of the trading book, I mean it's just wrong. And some of these numbers are so inaccurate that they published that they should publish them with the disclosure saying, we know these are highly inaccurate like the CCAR test. We know that this is not remotely related to reality or stuff like that. So it's almost a dishonest disclosure of these things, like do the actual number.\n\nThe second thing they really should do, which I think they're doing is what is the intended effect and what's the unintended effect. So we talk about -- we've gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 public companies. We've gone from pushing mortgages out of the banking system to a huge buildup in parts of the nonbank institutions and a huge amount of arbitrage taking place. I was a regulator, I'd be looking at all that and say, my God, is that what I wanted. And the biggest frustration is they couldn't fixed all these things, reduce liquidity, reduce capital, all these things and made the system safer.\n\nSo we had a Silicon Valley Bank blow up because they're so focused on governance, they forgot to focus on interest rate exposure. And they are making changes that, like what is actually real risk banks are bearing as opposed to walk signaling on what a bank should be doing all the time. So hopefully, they'll do it. I think they're devoted to doing it. Like look at their words and their speeches, I'm talking about the OCC, the Fed, the FDIC. So I think it's very good. Let's get it done quickly.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let’s dive into what we’re seeing on the regulatory front with the new administration and the anticipated Basel III end game. \n\nFirst off, regarding the new administration, we've noticed a more proactive stance on financial regulation. The focus seems to be on enhancing transparency and resilience within the financial system. This includes a push for greater scrutiny in stress testing and capital requirements. On the ground, we're seeing regulators take a collaborative approach, engaging with banks to understand the practical implications of proposed changes. This dialogue is crucial, and it's something we're actively participating in to ensure that any new regulations are both effective and workable.\n\nAs for the Basel III end game, the timeline remains a bit fluid, but we're expecting more concrete details to emerge over the next several quarters. The discussions have been ongoing, and while the July 2023 proposal set the stage, feedback from the industry has been significant. We anticipate some adjustments to the initial proposals, particularly in areas concerning risk-weighted assets and the leverage ratio.

      "question": "My first one is for you, Jeremy. Under the category no good deed goes unpunished. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the expense outlook for '26. You mentioned that $100 billion could be a little low and that you're in the middle of the planning cycle. That would imply 4% growth year-over-year. Is that the sort of new normal labor rate inflation that we should assume at this point?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Erika, just add to that, medical, we spent $3 billion or so in medical. That's going to be up 10% next year. And so when you look at some of these things, and we know that already and maybe we think it actually might be up another 10% in 2027 for a whole bunch of different reasons. And that's one thing. The other thing about comp, I just want to point it out, there's normal inflation and pay-for-performance, all that. There's a lot of pressure on -- from other people who are paying people quite well, hedge funds, law firms, private equity, nonbank financial institutions, and we are going to pay our people competitively. That is sine qua non if you want to have a great company for the next 20 years.\n\nAnd so there's some of that, too. I'm not sure that it's going to change very much when you look at it but I would put in the back of your mind, too. It's probably good for you all to hear me say that. [ It will be true ] for research.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let's take a step back and talk about the broader context here. We've been in a period of significant investment across the board—whether it's technology, cybersecurity, or talent acquisition. These are not just expenses; they're strategic investments that position us for the future. Now, about that $100 billion figure and the 4% growth you mentioned—it's a good starting point for understanding our planning. \n\nGiven the current economic environment, including labor market dynamics and inflationary pressures, it's reasonable to expect some level of cost increase. But remember, we're not going to sit on our hands here. We're actively managing these costs and looking for efficiencies wherever we can find them. The goal is to ensure that every dollar spent is driving value for our clients and shareholders. \n\nWe'll continue to navigate these challenges with a focus on delivering strong financial performance while investing in areas critical to our long-term success. So, while 4% might be a rough ballpark figure for now, we're adaptable and will adjust our plans as necessary to reflect the economic realities and opportunities that lie ahead.",

      "question": "I'll make sure to send this transcript to my boss. But the second question is actually for you, Jamie. You have always had a differentiated way of thinking about risk and a 2-part question for you. Number one, I feel like we don't even know what the right questions are to ask when it comes to NDFI exposure and risk, which is such a broad category. And so a 2-part question here. Number one, what would be the questions you think investors should ask when assessing NDFI exposure as it relates to future credit risk? And second, should investors be concerned about the SSFA accounting for RWAs in certain structures where you could lower the RWAs to NDFI exposures from 100% to something much lower?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Which SSFA?\n\nIs that insurance related.\n\nMaybe we take a crack and tell you a little bit more about it. We feel fairly comfortable with our exposure in that. But I think what you should do is -- I think when we have a downturn, this is the important thing, there will be a credit cycle. And we shouldn't be surprised. The credit card losses go up, middle market loss go up, everything gets worse in a downturn in credit. I do suspect -- I can't prove this, and I don't know because we don't know everyone's underwriting standards. Every now and we see what someone else is doing, we're surprised that their standards are not particularly good, but that's always been true. I suspect when there's a downturn, you will see higher than normal downturn type of credit losses in certain categories. I just suspect that.\n\nAnd so the other thing, which you can do, which I'm going to ask Mike Grub to do for me because I asked periodically, look at the pricing of BDCs and their publicly traded private credit facilities and do the homework. There are disclosures around that, and we do it. And so maybe we take just a crack at one point, laying out the different carriers of MBFIs and ones that might be concerning and ones that aren't concerning.",
      "generated_answer": "Alright, let's dive into this. When we talk about Non-Depository Financial Institutions (NDFIs), it's important to first acknowledge that these institutions play a significant role in the financial ecosystem, but they come with their own set of risks and challenges.\n\n### Part 1: Questions Investors Should Ask About NDFI Exposure\n\n1. **What is the Nature of the Exposure?**\n   - Investors should start by understanding the specific types of NDFI exposures a bank has. Are these exposures tied to lending, securities, or derivatives? Each carries different risk profiles.\n\n2. **Credit Quality and Counterparty Risk:**\n   - What is the credit quality of the NDFIs in question? How diversified is the exposure across different counterparties? A concentrated exposure to a few NDFIs can pose significant risks.\n\n3. **Market Conditions and Stress Scenarios:**\n   - How would these exposures perform under different economic scenarios? It's crucial to assess how resilient these NDFIs are in periods of market stress or economic downturns.\n\n4. **Regulatory Environment:**\n   - Are there any regulatory changes on the horizon that could impact NDFIs? Understanding the evolving regulatory landscape is key to anticipating future risks.\n\n5. **Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies:**\n   - What risk management strategies are in place to mitigate potential losses from NDFI exposures? This includes hedging strategies, collateral requirements, and other safeguards.\n\n### Part 2: Concerns About SSFA Accounting for RWAs\n\nRegarding the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) and its impact on Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs), this is indeed a crucial area to scrutinize.\n\n1. **Understanding the Mechanics:**\n   - Investors should understand how SSFA is used to calculate RWAs for certain structured exposures. It's a complex formula that can significantly impact the perceived risk of these assets.\n\n2. **Potential for Risk Underestimation:**\n   - There's a concern that SSFA might underestimate the actual risk by allowing for lower RWAs, especially in structures with tranches or layers of risk. Investors need to assess whether the reduction in RWAs truly reflects a commensurate reduction in risk.\n\n3. **Transparency and Assumptions:**\n   - Are the assumptions and inputs into the SSFA model transparent and robust? It's crucial to ensure that these models accurately capture the risk characteristics of the underlying exposures.\n\n4. **Impact on Capital Requirements:**\n   - How does the use of SSFA impact the bank's overall capital requirements? Lower RWAs can lead to lower capital buffers, which might not be prudent in certain market conditions.\n\nIn summary, investors should be diligent in asking the right questions and ensuring that the risk from NDFI exposures is accurately reflected in a bank's financials. As always, we at JPMorgan Chase are committed to maintaining transparency and robust risk management practices to protect our stakeholders. Remember, we're not going to sit on our hands when it comes to managing risk. We're prepared for all eventualities, and that's how we maintain our competitive edge.",

      "question": "Okay. I'll follow up on that. And secondly, with the Sapphire refresh, just assume that we're starting to see some of the awards amortization show in the card fees line and in the card revenue rate. So I'm just wondering if you could kind of walk us through that now that, that card is coming on and you mentioned good additions there. Just what do we have to think about in terms of what leads the horse in terms of card revenue rate and eventual volume growth and related benefits.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The fee comes in over a year and some of these rewards come into negative NII over a year.\n\nIt's one example of like really bad accounting.",
      "generated_answer": "Alright, let's dig into the Sapphire refresh and how it's impacting our card fees and revenue rate. First off, we've seen strong customer response to the refresh, which is great. The new features and benefits are driving good cardholder additions, which is exactly what we aimed for.\n\nNow, with any card refresh, particularly one with enhanced rewards like Sapphire, you're going to see some initial impacts from awards amortization. This will show up in the card fees line as we continue to amortize these upfront rewards over time. It's a standard part of the process with a card of this nature.\n\nIn terms of revenue rate and volume growth, think of it as a two-step dance. Initially, the focus is on acquiring new cardholders and encouraging existing ones to engage more deeply with the card. This sets the stage for increased spending volume, which is where we start to see the real benefits kick in.\n\nAs volume grows, it contributes positively to the card revenue rate. Higher volumes translate to more interchange fees, and as customers utilize their cards more, we also see an uptick in interest income from revolving balances. So, while there's an upfront hit from rewards amortization, the long-term play is all about volume growth driving revenue.\n\nWe're keeping a close eye on these metrics and remain confident that the investments we're making in the Sapphire card will pay off in terms of enhanced customer engagement and revenue growth. We're not sitting on our hands here; this refresh is part of our broader strategy to strengthen our position in the competitive credit card market. So, expect us to continue pushing forward with initiatives that support this growth trajectory.",

      "question": "Related to the 15% long-term national retail deposit market share, does your pricing need to be materially different from recent history? Or said another way, do you need to price a little bit more competitive to get that 4 points of improvement over time?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The retail branch system, as Jeremy said, deepening. But remember, it's better products, better services, more branches and better location, deepening with customer segmentation. If we do a good job in all that, then we hope to gain share. And I think we are doing a good job on that but that -- we have to deliver that for a year to get to 15%.\n\nFolks, thank you very much, for spending time with us. We'll talk to you all soon.",
      "generated_answer": "Let's break this down a bit. We've got a strong position already, with a 15% market share in national retail deposits, which is nothing to scoff at. Now, you're asking if we need to adjust our pricing strategy to gain another 4 percentage points in market share over time.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the current state. The financial landscape is always competitive, and deposit pricing is one lever among many to attract and retain customers. We've been seeing some margin compression due to lower rates and competitive pressures, as noted in our recent quarterly report. The question, though, is whether we need to make a material shift in our pricing strategy.\n\nHistorically, we've balanced competitive pricing with excellent service, strong digital offerings, and a broad branch network to maintain and grow our market share. While pricing is important, it's not the only factor at play. Customers are looking for value, convenience, and trust, all of which we deliver through our various channels and services.\n\nNow, in terms of being more competitive with pricing, we always keep an eye on the market dynamics and adjust as necessary. We're not going to sit on our hands. We're prepared to be competitive where it makes sense, but we're also going to leverage our other strengths. Our investment in technology and customer experience, as well as our focus on innovation, plays a crucial role in attracting deposits.\n\nSo, while we might tweak our pricing here and there to remain competitive, it's part of a broader strategy. We're not solely relying on pricing to gain market share. We're focused on the total package we offer our customers. As always, we’re prepared for all eventualities, and we’ll do whatever it takes to maintain our leadership and achieve that growth target.",
