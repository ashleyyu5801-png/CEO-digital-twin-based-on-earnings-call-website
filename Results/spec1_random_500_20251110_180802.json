      "question": "Yes, good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence, but Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be -- the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players, given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of the ability of the banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward? And maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that banking -- the banking system should be a source of strength?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Everyone trades stocks in a different way. So, sentiment -- but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too.\n\nAnd I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the next month.\n\nAnd then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you see that.\n\nAnd anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is.\n\nI just also want to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion. And then, to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month -- three-quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stock will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",
      "generated_answer": "Sure, let me address that. First, it's important to recognize that the banking system today is fundamentally strong. We've built up significant capital and liquidity over the years, thanks to the regulatory framework put in place after the financial crisis. This means that banks, including JPMorgan, are well-capitalized and have robust liquidity buffers, which allow us to withstand economic shocks and continue to serve our clients and communities effectively.\n\nWhen we talk about economic turbulence, it's crucial to distinguish between short-term volatility and long-term structural issues. The current economic environment does have its challenges, like potential inflation, geopolitical tensions, and various uncertainties. However, the banking system is well-positioned to navigate through these challenges and support economic stability.\n\nNow, regarding Jeremy's point about the banking system being a source of strength, this is about our role in the broader economy. Banks are integral to facilitating credit and liquidity, which are essential for economic activity. In times of economic slowdown, banks can provide the necessary funding and support to businesses and consumers, helping to mitigate the impacts of a downturn.\n\nIt's true that the equity markets often react based on sentiment and fear, sometimes overlooking the underlying strength and resilience of banks. But it's our job to manage through these cycles, focus on the fundamentals, and continue to serve our clients and communities. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and being a reliable partner in the economy, regardless of the market's perception at any given moment.\n\nIn summary, while there may be economic turbulence ahead, I believe the banking system, and JPMorgan in particular, is equipped to handle it and will continue to play a vital role in supporting economic growth and stability.",

      "question": "Okay, got it. And then, just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Just are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then, we have, depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that, but based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment and that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So -- but we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let me address that in a couple of ways. First off, our primary focus is always to ensure that we have a fortress balance sheet. We want to be well-positioned to handle whatever macroeconomic uncertainties come our way. That's just prudent risk management. Now, when it comes to capital deployment, we constantly evaluate our investment opportunities and our capital return strategy, including buybacks, based on the current market conditions and our long-term strategic goals.\n\nIf the stock is trading at a value we consider attractive, we'll consider buybacks as a way to return capital to shareholders, but we're not going to do it indiscriminately. We need to balance that with our need to invest in the business, whether it's technology, expanding our presence in key markets, or enhancing our product offerings. We're always looking to deploy capital where it will bring the best long-term returns for our shareholders.\n\nThat being said, we're mindful of the macro environment, and we won't hesitate to be more conservative if we think that's in the best interest of the company and our stakeholders. Our approach is dynamic, and we adjust as necessary to ensure we're making the best decisions with the information we have at the time.",

      "question": "Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US treasuries if those reforms are implemented? And just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some of the recent volatility?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. So, SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which has deep flaws in them, to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks. It's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change.\n\nThe reason to change some of these things is so banks -- the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't -- if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea, but every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So, they should make these changes.\n\nThe reason why is when you have very -- lot of volatile markets and very widespread and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks themselves. And anyway -- and we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate the markets, help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no -- basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",
      "generated_answer": "Right, thanks for the question. So first, on the proposed changes to the SLR, we think any relief or adjustment to the SLR is a step in the right direction. The SLR, as it currently stands, doesn't adequately reflect the risk profiles of different assets, like U.S. Treasuries, which are fundamentally low-risk. So any reform that allows for a more risk-sensitive measure would certainly help us manage balance sheet constraints and continue to support the treasury market.\n\nThat said, while relief on the SLR would be helpful, we're always careful in how we manage our rate risk across the firm. Rate volatility is something we anticipate and prepare for. Our balance sheet is structured to be resilient. We have a diverse set of assets and liabilities, and we actively manage our interest rate exposure. We're not just looking at U.S. Treasuries, but also considering the broader macroeconomic environment, geopolitical factors, and global demand for different securities.\n\nIn terms of our appetite for purchasing U.S. Treasuries, we remain committed to supporting our clients and the treasury markets, but we'll do so in a manner that aligns with our risk management framework and overall strategic goals. We always weigh the potential returns against the risks, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach.\n\nOverall, we take a holistic view of rate risk management, considering a variety of factors, and we believe we're well-positioned to navigate the current environment. The key is to stay flexible and adaptive, given the ongoing volatility and geopolitical uncertainties.",

      "question": "Very good. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads, that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system. And there should be -- and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, I appreciate the question. I think it's important to remember that regulatory reform is a complex process that involves multiple stakeholders, including not just the administration, but also Congress and various regulatory agencies. While new personnel can bring fresh perspectives, it's not a guarantee of immediate change. That said, we are hopeful that the new administration will take a thoughtful approach to regulation that considers the balance between maintaining a safe and sound banking system and allowing for economic growth and innovation.\n\nWe believe there's an opportunity for regulatory recalibration that aligns with economic realities and the needs of the financial system. This could include re-evaluating certain capital and liquidity requirements, like the SLR and G-SIB buffers, to ensure they are effective and not overly burdensome. It's crucial that any reform is based on data and sound economic principles and that it takes into account the global competitive landscape.\n\nWe're committed to working constructively with regulators and policymakers to achieve outcomes that support a robust and resilient financial system. Ultimately, it's about finding the right balance that allows banks to serve their clients effectively while also safeguarding the broader economy.",

      "question": "Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you will have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates? Are the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs, is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all of that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him in the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with -- around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle, they're not going to be -- trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let me address that by saying that the macro environment is indeed quite complex right now. We've seen a shift from the initial optimism surrounding a pro-business administration to a landscape filled with various challenges, including trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and regulatory concerns. When I speak with corporate clients and CEOs, they're primarily looking for clarity and stability. They want to see a clear path forward on trade policies, especially with major trading partners. \n\nThe 90-day pause on tariffs is a step in the right direction, but it's more of a temporary relief rather than a long-term solution. What businesses really need is a comprehensive trade agreement that provides predictability and fairness. They are also keen on seeing consistent regulatory policies and tax frameworks that won't change with every new headline. \n\nIn essence, for confidence to return to levels we saw earlier, we need sustained progress in these areas. Companies need the assurance that they can plan for the future without the risk of sudden policy shifts. Once there's a sense of stability and predictability, I think you'll see companies feel more comfortable about their guidance and their willingness to invest and expand.",

      "analyst": "Ebrahim Poonawala",
      "question": "Got it. And I guess, as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of week. Just your comfort level in terms of the functioning of the treasury market? Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Any color would be great.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you, I don't think that's going to go away and that relates to that. Obviously, the US dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed -- we've been consistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently it happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened, that will happen and then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we don't know if and when that's going to happen and we'll see.\n\nBut the notion that the 10-year treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, we have huge global deficits back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter, tariffs, at least our economists think, will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So, we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",
      "generated_answer": "Look, the treasury market is incredibly important, not just for the U.S., but for the global economy. It's the foundation of the financial system, so it's crucial that it functions smoothly. We've seen volatility and some liquidity issues, but I think it's important to remember that markets can be volatile for a variety of reasons. \n\nAs for the Fed, they have a lot of tools at their disposal, and they’ve shown in the past that they’re willing to step in when necessary to ensure market stability. We’ve seen them act decisively before, and they have the capacity to do so again if needed. \n\nI wouldn't want to speculate on their specific actions, but it's clear that they’re very aware of the situation and are monitoring it closely. In the meantime, we at JPMorgan are focused on managing our own risks and ensuring we continue to serve our clients effectively through any market conditions.",

      "question": "Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive -- as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "I'll just also say that it may not be deposits, it may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen, which is different, is not the risk-off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. What we've observed in periods of heightened volatility is that both corporates and investors often seek the safety of cash, which can lead to an increase in deposits. During March, and particularly through April, we did notice a trend of rising deposits. This is not uncommon as market participants look to de-risk their portfolios and maintain liquidity during uncertain times. \n\nFor us, this translates to a stronger deposit base, which in turn supports our liquidity position. It's important to note that while increased deposits are generally a positive in terms of liquidity, they also come with the responsibility of managing that liquidity effectively to ensure we are optimizing our balance sheet and capital allocation. \n\nWe remain focused on balancing the growth in deposits with prudent liquidity management and capital deployment, keeping in mind the overall economic environment and our strategic objectives.",

      "question": "Thanks. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jeremy. Two questions, one for Jamie to kick off. Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Again, almost impossible to answer. We look at all the cycles. We prepare for a full range of outcomes. So, not -- I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold, but I do -- I pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months. So, maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that.\n\nBut it's -- the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down. It looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know. But we are -- I've been quite cautious and you can see it in our capital, liquidity, our position, our balance sheet, and so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thanks for the question. When we talk about cycles, it's important to remember that each one tends to have its unique characteristics, although there are often some recurring themes. The current environment is quite different from previous cycles in several ways. We've got a mix of factors at play, including the aftermath of the pandemic, unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions, all of which are contributing to inflationary pressures.\n\nIf we look back at previous cycles, this isn't quite like anything we've seen before. The inflation we're experiencing is different from what we've seen in the past, partly because it's driven by factors like supply chain issues and shifts in consumer behavior. This isn't the 1970s, where inflation was largely a monetary phenomenon. It's more complex now.\n\nIn terms of what this cycle could look like going forward, we might see some elements of the traditional cycle, including a slowdown as the economy adjusts to higher interest rates and as the stimulus effects wear off. However, the exact path will depend on a lot of moving parts, including how quickly supply chains normalize, how the labor market evolves, and what happens with fiscal policy.\n\nOne thing we do know is that the economic fundamentals in the U.S. are strong. Consumers are in good shape, with healthy balance sheets, and businesses are generally doing well. But we do have to watch out for potential headwinds, such as changes in fiscal policy, rising costs, and geopolitical developments.\n\nSo, while this cycle has some unique features, we must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to whatever comes our way. The banking system is strong, and we'll continue to focus on serving our clients and managing risk effectively.",

      "question": "Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a \"deep recognition of flaws\" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put -- you or Jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid as much as red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you'd pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation?\n\nBut before that, the negative which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman letter about the trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars \"get over it\" to this week say \"do something.\" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened? And do you really think next earnings call will be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about to \"get over it,\" I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it.\n\nYou may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade. So -- and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of -- obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about \"get over it.\" I did not change my view about it.\n\nI would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too. Maybe the extent they want to do it, they said they're having conversations with 70 or 80 different people. And so, I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system.\n\nAnd I don't -- I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see, okay? There will be thousands -- hundreds of people maybe, but it's not going to be [passed on] (ph), but it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages if it's done right.\n\nI specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing that right now.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. Let me address the trade wars first. Initially, when I said \"get over it,\" the expectation was that these trade tensions would be short-lived and resolved through negotiations. The reality, as we’ve seen, is more complex and drawn out than anticipated, affecting markets and creating uncertainty for businesses globally. It’s become apparent that the ongoing trade disputes are impacting supply chains and business sentiment, and that’s why I’ve shifted to saying \"do something.\" We need clarity and resolution to remove the overhang of uncertainty, and I think it’s crucial for both sides to come to the table with pragmatic solutions. Whether we’ll be through most of the uncertainty by the next earnings call is hard to predict, but I’m hopeful that progress can be made.\n\nNow, regarding the regulatory landscape and potential savings from deregulation, there's indeed a \"deep recognition of flaws\" in how some of these regulations have been implemented. The goal should always be to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system without unnecessary complexity or cost. In an ideal scenario, we could streamline processes, remove redundancies, and reduce compliance costs, which in turn would allow us to pass savings onto customers and improve efficiency. These savings could be significant, but it's hard to put a concrete number on them without specific regulatory changes in place. What I can say is that a more efficient regulatory environment would not only cut costs but also foster innovation and competition, ultimately benefiting the entire financial ecosystem.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "If you do all -- if you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%. And the reason for that isn't -- it's not just capital. It is also LCR. It is also G-SIFIs.\n\nAnd the question you should ask, because you are very smart, Mike, is could you -- have the same -- and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to the First Republic of Silicon Valley, and you can accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nYou can read our -- I think our [MPRs] (ph) are public and stuff like that. And so, they should do that, just make a better system. We have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly.

      "generated_answer": "Your question touches on an important topic regarding capital requirements and their impact on lending. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is a critical measure of a bank's financial strength, and adjustments to this ratio can significantly affect our lending capacity. \n\nIf we were to lower the CET1 ratio by one-fifth, as you mentioned, it could potentially free up hundreds of billions of dollars in capital, allowing us to extend more credit to businesses and consumers. This would support economic growth by providing additional funding for investments and consumption. \n\nHowever, it's essential to balance this with maintaining a robust capital buffer to ensure the bank's resilience in times of financial stress. While reducing the CET1 ratio might enhance lending capacity, we must also consider the regulatory environment and the importance of maintaining confidence among our stakeholders. \n\nUltimately, any changes to capital requirements would involve careful consideration and dialogue with regulators to ensure that we are supporting economic growth while preserving the safety and soundness of the financial system.",

We continuously engage with policymakers and stakeholders to advocate for policies that promote stable and prosperous economic environments. We're also very focused on maintaining a strong risk management framework, which helps us navigate these challenges effectively.\n\nWhile it is true that trade tensions can create uncertainties and potential headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to adapt and thrive.

The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are you -- are the systems better? Are they better able to handle it as your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy -- I agree with Jeremy. I'd add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid/ask spreads that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes, so you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps and a whole bunch of different things, treasuries, that's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you're seeing in DCM today, when you don't have bond deals, when you have less trading, when you have -- so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients. So, we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads go up or down and pretty bad.\n\nBut the plumbing of the system, I would say, the plumbing worked well during COVID, too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and it wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had. So -- but you're always worried about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",
      "generated_answer": "A: Well, look, the volatility we've experienced has been quite significant, and it's important to recognize that not all volatility is beneficial for markets or for banks. However, I do believe that the systems we have in place have become more robust over time. We've invested heavily in risk management, technology, and talent to ensure that we can handle these kinds of environments better.\n\nThe regulatory framework, despite its complexities and flaws, has pushed banks to hold more capital and liquidity, which has certainly helped us weather the storm. Our diverse platform allows us to serve clients in various markets and geographies, which provides us with some cushion against localized disruptions. \n\nBut I want to be clear that we remain vigilant. We're constantly assessing our risk exposures and ensuring that we can deal with extreme scenarios. We can't control market volatility, but we can control how we manage it and how we prepare for it. And yes, the trading results have been strong, but they're a function of the environment and our ability to adapt quickly to client needs.\n\nAt the end of the day, we have to stay humble and recognize that markets can always surprise you.

      "question": "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess, how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts? If you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn, I think you do have -- in the $95 billion guidance, you do have good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you -- does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments or do you think that's just completely short sighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "As you said management thing, because I think it's very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses, and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off. And -- but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can imagine -- if you go to -- if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail.\n\nAnd so, there is -- we're making a -- I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID, the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the -- and Mike Mayo mentioned the thing about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit.\n\nI mean, we -- I pointed out resolution recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long, okay? It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long, okay? We report 1 trillion -- I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the -- all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we -- that hopefully we can get rid of and reduce the cost of the system and -- but it's not new branches. So, the folks here are working on, we call, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that. So -- and we're having fun doing it. It's like -- to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so -- and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me start by saying that we always want to be prudent and thoughtful about our cost structure, but it's important to remember that our investments in bankers, branches, technology, and marketing are made with a long-term view. We don't manage the company for short-term fluctuations, and we believe that maintaining a focus on serving our clients and building for the future is key to our success.\n\nEven if we see a revenue slowdown without a severe downturn, we would be hesitant to pull back on these strategic investments. Historically, we've found that continuing to invest through cycles positions us well when conditions improve. This doesn't mean we're not focused on efficiencies. We're always looking for ways to optimize and ensure we're spending wisely. But pulling back on investments that drive growth and enhance our competitive position would be short-sighted unless there was a significant and prolonged downturn in the economy.\n\nWe're committed to being disciplined about our expenses while ensuring we're making the necessary investments to support our clients and seize opportunities in the marketplace. We'll continue to monitor the environment closely and make adjustments as needed, but our focus remains on building a durable and competitive franchise for the long term.",

      "question": "Jamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to?\n\nAnd secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Chris, just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture, so nothing has happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that.\n\nAnd then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing.\n\nAnd how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for America? And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let's tackle that question.\n\nOn the first point about optimism on financial deregulation, I think it's important to have a balanced perspective. There's certainly been some talk about easing regulations, and that's been a positive conversation for the industry. However, it's early days, and we need to see how these discussions translate into actionable policy changes. What we want is thoughtful regulation that ensures the safety and soundness of the financial system while allowing banks to effectively serve their clients and support economic growth. The key is finding the right balance between robust oversight and operational flexibility.\n\nOn the second point regarding capital, we've always emphasized our disciplined approach to capital management. We maintain a strong capital base to support our clients through thick and thin. In terms of uses of capital, our priorities remain consistent: organic growth, acquisitions that make strategic sense, dividends, and share buybacks. We're committed to returning capital to our shareholders, but that has to be balanced with maintaining the financial strength to support our clients and invest in opportunities that drive long-term growth.\n\nAs for the timing, it hinges on several factors, including economic conditions, regulatory developments, and market opportunities. We're prepared to act when the right opportunities arise, and we'll continue to communicate our strategy and decisions transparently to our shareholders.\n\nOverall, while there's optimism about potential regulatory changes, we remain focused on executing our strategy and delivering value to our clients and shareholders.",

First, we always prioritize businesses where we see significant long-term growth potential and where we can leverage our existing strengths.\n\nIn terms of specific areas, asset management is a space where scale is crucial, and any deal that enhances our distribution capabilities or product offerings could be very attractive. Payments and fintech are also areas where we see a lot of potential. We've been investing heavily in technology and digital capabilities, and any acquisition that complements those initiatives or enhances our customer experience would be of interest.\n\nAnother area would be the Commercial Bank, where expanding our geographic footprint or adding new industry verticals could be beneficial.

      "ground_truth_answer": "So this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer. So we think the customer has the right to, if they want to share their information. What we asked people to do is, what are they -- do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It should be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because somebody of these things going on for years.

So we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it.\n\nThe last thing is a liability shift. I mean I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that.\n\nAnd if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third-party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility in their part.

      "ground_truth_answer": "You can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We've built, I think 500 bank of the innovation economy, which is kind of new to us. I think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business, regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next 6 to 9 months.",
      "generated_answer": "A: Sure, happy to address that. The middle market businesses in the U.S. are generally in a good position right now. We've seen quite a bit of resilience from these companies, and they're managing through the current economic environment with a fair amount of agility. Interest rates, tariffs, and consumer spending are certainly factors that could pose challenges, but these businesses have been navigating through such issues for some time now.\n\nIn terms of interest rates, while rising rates can increase borrowing costs, they also typically signal a strengthening economy, which is beneficial for business growth. As for tariffs, many companies have already adapted to supply chain disruptions and cost increases, though it remains an ongoing concern. Consumer spending, which has been strong, could slow, but we're not seeing an immediate risk that's out of line with normal economic fluctuations.\n\nFrom a credit quality perspective, we're not overly concerned at this stage. We maintain a disciplined approach to risk management, and the underlying credit quality of our middle market portfolio remains solid. As always, we're keeping a close eye on economic indicators and are prepared to adjust our strategies as needed. But overall, we're confident that the middle market sector will continue to perform well, barring any unexpected macroeconomic shocks.",

      "question": "Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography?\n\nAnd Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And to answer your other question, Mike. So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second.\n\nSo G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and stuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book.\n\nAnd when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",
      "generated_answer": "A: Sure, let me start. On commercial loan growth, we've seen some solid momentum across a number of regions, with particular strength in areas like the Southeast and the Midwest. This growth is largely driven by increased business investment and a pickup in economic activity as businesses are gaining confidence and looking to expand or invest in new projects. We're also seeing some increase in loan utilization rates as companies tap into their credit lines to support inventory buildup and capital expenditures.\n\nNow, turning to the regulatory side, I think there's always more that can be done to foster an environment conducive to lending. One thing regulators could focus on is streamlining some of the capital and liquidity requirements that have been put in place post-crisis. While these rules were necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system, there's room for recalibration to balance safety with the ability to lend more freely. Another area is reducing some of the bureaucratic hurdles around small business lending. By simplifying some of the processes and requirements, we could see more capital flowing to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are crucial for job creation and economic growth. Overall, a thoughtful approach to regulation can help banks deploy capital more effectively in support of the broader economy.",

      "question": "You didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, and I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things can reduce the actual cost of making loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we've just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, the cost to make a loan is an important factor, and there's always room for streamlining. At JPMorgan, we constantly look for ways to make our processes more efficient, whether it's through technology, automation, or simplification of our procedures. We're investing significantly in technology to improve our systems and reduce manual processes, which in turn should lower the cost of making a loan. This includes digital platforms that enhance the customer experience, allowing us to process loans more quickly and with fewer errors. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, we can also better assess credit risk, thereby making more informed lending decisions. Ultimately, the goal is to not only reduce costs but also to improve the overall customer experience, making it easier and faster for clients to access the financing they need.",

Private credit is certainly an area that's garnered a lot of attention, and we're always evaluating potential avenues for growth, whether it's organic or inorganic.

      "generated_answer": "When I refer to \"peak private credit,\" I'm talking about the significant growth we've seen in the private credit markets. Over the last several years, there's been a substantial increase in the amount of capital flowing into private credit, as more investors seek higher yields in a low-interest-rate environment. This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including regulatory changes that have pushed some lending outside of the traditional banking system, as well as the rise of non-bank lenders who can operate with different constraints than banks.\n\nHowever, with this rapid expansion, we should be mindful of the potential risks that can accompany such growth. These could include an increase in leverage, the potential for less stringent underwriting standards, and the concentration of risk in certain sectors or asset classes. It's important for investors and regulators alike to monitor these developments closely. While private credit has been a valuable addition to the financial ecosystem, we must ensure that it continues to operate in a manner that supports economic stability and growth.\n\nIn sum, when I say \"peak private credit,\" I'm acknowledging both the impressive growth we've seen in this area and the need for caution moving forward to mitigate any potential systemic risks that could emerge from this trend.",

      "question": "Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "In a competitive world, it is irrational to thing that -- and when it applies to all the competitors that everyone is just going to make a lot more money to keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.\n\nAnd Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. Now they should do a low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff, if you didn't do, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns. That we just -- we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches, that does our private bank or things like that.",
      "generated_answer": "Right, that's a good question. So, if we do get to a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both capital and liquidity constraints, it could indeed have an impact on our natural ROTCE. The idea of regulatory simplification is to make the system more efficient and reduce unnecessary burdens, which can free up capital and resources that can be deployed elsewhere. \n\nHowever, the extent to which this would be additive to our ROTCE would depend on several factors. First, while simplification might reduce some costs and capital requirements, it might also lead to increased competition as everyone in the industry benefits from the same reduced constraints. That could put some pressure on pricing and margins, potentially offsetting some of the gains.\n\nSecond, any benefit we derive would likely be partly passed on to our clients in terms of pricing, as the market is quite competitive. If we're able to operate more efficiently, we want to ensure that our clients also benefit from those efficiencies, which strengthens our relationships and could lead to more business.\n\nOverall, while a more streamlined regulatory framework could help improve ROTCE, it's not solely about improving returns; it's about how we can better serve our clients and continue growing the business sustainably. The actual impact on ROTCE will depend on how these changes play out across the industry and how we and our competitors respond to them.",

And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement.\n\nAnd the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly, we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it -- does activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels, or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you might want to -- I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. And so that lesson we've learned over and over, it may stay wide open for 1.5 years. Something may happen geopolitically that all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yes, you're going to have really active markets.\n\nI do think that extending the tax bill for business to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done.\n\nI also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial Liberation Day, now there's more talk as more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed, that reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. Look, we did see a pickup in activity levels late in the quarter, and it's a combination of factors. I think some of the extreme outcomes that people were concerned about, particularly around trade tariffs, have been alleviated to some extent. There's a bit more clarity there, and that helps. Tax reform has also provided a clearer backdrop, which is encouraging businesses to think more about longer-term investments. \n\nBut I wouldn't say all concerns have been fully taken off the table. There's still a lot of uncertainty in the global environment, whether it's geopolitical tensions or broader economic conditions. Our clients are navigating these challenges, but they are also looking at opportunities to grow and invest. So, while the sentiment has improved and that’s reflected in the activity levels, I would say it's cautious optimism. \n\nWe're prepared to support our clients through whatever comes, and we've positioned ourselves well to take advantage of opportunities. But it's important to stay vigilant and adaptable, given the ever-changing environment. So, while we’re seeing positive signs, we're also keeping an eye on potential risks and ensuring that we're ready to handle whatever might come our way in the second half of the year.",

      "question": "Okay. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators looked at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks, or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheet into lower-risk assets. Do you see that -- is it really just a supply issue? Or how do you think about the demand/supply dynamic? And is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower-margin areas? Just your thoughts.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And I'm like a broken record. It's not SLR, it's LCR, it's G-SIFI, it's CCAR, it's Basel IV, the gold-plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, et cetera. And even how you measure liquidity, which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery. They should look at all of that. If they really want to fix the system.",
      "generated_answer": "A: Thanks for that question. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) is an important metric for us, and any adjustment to it can have significant implications for how we manage our balance sheet. When regulators talk about adjusting the SLR, the idea is often to give banks more flexibility to support economic growth by expanding into lower-risk assets without being overly constrained by capital requirements.\n\nIn terms of supply and demand, it's more about where we see opportunities to deploy our balance sheet effectively. There's always a balance between taking on more assets and ensuring we're getting a proper return on capital. Lower-margin areas can indeed be attractive if the risk-adjusted returns make sense, and if the regulatory environment allows us to optimize our capital allocation efficiently.\n\nThe key here is not just about having the capacity to grow but doing so in a way that aligns with our strategic goals and risk appetite. We continuously evaluate our options and look for areas where we can serve our clients better while maintaining strong financial and risk management discipline. It's a dynamic process, and we'll be looking closely at any changes in the SLR to see how they might help us better support our clients and the broader economy.",

Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the onetime effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is.\n\nAnd if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was guidance -- guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some onetime -- not onetime items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially -- I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE, which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you can answer this one. I just might add really be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we cannot just earn 17% ROTCE is that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17% you're a bond, then you will trade at 3x tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing.\n\nIf you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers internationally. And when we look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe is it's been great. Innovation economy has been great. We're gaining shares in a lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the international -- payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that is the best way to use it.\n\nYou have all of our major bank competitors are back, rolling and expanding. Then you have the fintech folks, who are quite capable and quite smart, who you don't want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion is that somehow we're not going to deal with tough competitors, right, which protects JPMorgan Chase, if we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on realizing -- you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day.\n\nAnd so we're quite cautious to just declare victory, like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, because I had Jeremy do this number one point, if you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America -- for 40 years maybe.",
      "generated_answer": "Sure, let me address that. First off, we're very pleased with the 20% return on tangible common equity this quarter. It reflects the strength of our business model and our ability to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders. However, it's important to recognize that there are certain tailwinds in the current environment that are contributing to these elevated returns. \n\nInterest rates have been a significant factor, providing a boost to our net interest income. Additionally, market conditions have been favorable in certain areas, such as trading and investment banking. These factors do play a role in enhancing our returns, and while they're beneficial, we need to be cautious about assuming they'll persist indefinitely.\n\nOur business has evolved over time, and we've made strategic investments and adjustments to adapt to changing market dynamics. We've strengthened our competitive position across various business lines, and that's contributing to our robust performance. But it's prudent to maintain our 17% ROTCE target as a long-term goal, recognizing that the current environment may be providing some temporary uplift.\n\nIt's a balance between acknowledging the strong performance we're delivering today and being mindful of the cyclical nature of some of these tailwinds. We want to ensure that we're setting expectations that are sustainable over the long term. Our focus remains on delivering value to our shareholders through disciplined capital management and strategic growth initiatives.",

      "question": "If I could get an answer to this from both you, Jeremy, and Jamie, the question really is how much of a risk is the lending to the NDFIs? Just -- I mean, because you guys are always outfront highlighting what could happen, whether it's cyber or as you point, labor market or inflation. And I feel like you haven't really highlighted this as a potential risk area. Maybe that's because you don't perceive it as such, but you have Tricolor, you have First Brands. One area of your biggest growth, I think, has been NDFIs over the last year.\n\nSo I'm just trying to put this in some sort of context that as it relates to Tricolor, who bears the losses? Does end investors in the funds? Is it -- do you put skin in the game and have your own investments? Are you an underwriter? Where are you exposed? So I guess I'm asking JPMorgan specifically but then Jamie more generally for the industry. Is this something that's flashing yellow that you are spending more time on? How should we think about that?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. Mike, I would just add that it's a very large category of nonbank financial institutions and probably a number like half of it, we would consider very traditional, not like different. There is a component, which is different today than it was years ago, and there's a component which isn't that different. But if you look at like COs, CLOs and lending to leveraged entities that are underwritten with leveraged loans, so there's kind of a little bit of double leverage in there.\n\nI would say that, yes, there will be additional risk in that category that we will see when we have a downturn. I expect to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be because we don't know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did. Jeremy said these are very smart players. They know what they're doing. They've been around a long time but they're not all very smart. And we don't even know the standards that other banks underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that some of those standards may not be as good as you think. Hopefully, we are very good, though we make our mistakes, too, obviously.\n\nSo yes, I think you'd be a little bit worse. We've had a benign credit environment for so long that I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate a little bit more than people think when, in fact, there's a downturn. And hopefully, it will be a fairly normal credit cycle. What always happens is something is worse than a normal credit cycle than a normal downturn. So we'll see. But we think we're quite careful. And obviously, we scour the world looking for things that we should be worried about.\n\nBut I do remind people, we've had a bull market for a long time. Asset prices are high, a lot of credit stuff that you would see out there, you will only see when there's a downturn.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. When it comes to lending to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), it's essential to understand both the opportunities and the risks involved. At JPMorgan, we always aim to maintain a well-diversified and balanced portfolio, and our approach to NDFIs is no different. \n\nFor starters, it's important to recognize that NDFIs can play a vital role in the financial ecosystem, providing credit and services that might not otherwise be available. We have been involved in lending to NDFIs, but we do so with a keen eye on risk management. We make sure that our exposures are carefully analyzed and that we have the necessary structures in place to mitigate risks.\n\nWhen it comes to specific entities like Tricolor or First Brands, the risk exposure varies depending on the nature of our involvement. In some cases, we might be underwriters, in others, we might have more direct exposure. We do our due diligence and ensure that we are adequately compensated for the risks we take on, and that we have appropriate controls in place.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, while there is a growing trend in lending to NDFIs, we don't see it as a systemic risk at this point. However, like with any growing segment, it's crucial to monitor developments closely. We have to stay vigilant and proactive in managing any potential risks, but we also recognize the value that these institutions can bring to the financial system. \n\nOverall, we manage our lending to NDFIs with the same rigor and discipline as we do with all our credit exposures, ensuring that we remain a strong and stable institution capable of navigating through various market conditions.",

      "question": "And so just a short follow-up after Tricolor, again, this is a real tiny drop in the bucket for you guys but have you gone back and looked at your processes and done anything different?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. I mean, Michael, you should assume that whenever something happens, we scour all process, all procedures, all underwriting, all everything. And we think we're okay in other stuff. But I -- my antenna goes up when things like that happen. And I probably shouldn't say this but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. And so we should -- everyone should be forewarn on this one. And first brands, I put in the same category. And there are a couple of other ones out that I've seen that I put in similar categories. So -- but we always look at these things, and we're not -- I'm nipping in. We make mistakes, too. So we'll see. There clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things. But that doesn't mean we can't improve our procedures.",
      "generated_answer": "Right, so it's important to note that while Tricolor might be a small part of our overall operations, we treat every aspect of our business with utmost diligence. We've gone back and reviewed our processes to ensure that we're consistently applying the highest standards across the board. This involves re-evaluating our due diligence and risk management protocols to make sure we're not only addressing any specific issues that arose, but also continuously improving our systems for the future.

      "question": "Jeremy, obviously, you guys are in the residential mortgage lending market, big players granted home lending. When you look at the revenue relative to banking and wealth management, obviously, it's not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be -- when they come out with comments, they follow up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessent has pointed out about a couple of months ago that he thinks there's a housing emergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is, what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the corresponding treasury yield, assuming the treasury yields don't go down. But what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower mortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity, of course, would pick up with that.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "So I'll take that one. First, on the supply side. I mean it's -- we know what it is. It's permitting, it's rules, it's local rules. It's how long it takes to get permits and build not my backyard, you can't build 2 stories in certain places. That's the supply side. The demand side -- and remember, don't always push homeownership. I was -- we made a huge mistake in the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I've been talking about it for years that they should focus on reducing requirements require and we think you reduce the cost of mortgages 30 to 40 basis points overall. without creating any additional risk. There is just excessive stuff put in place after the great financial crisis, which obviously demanded a response but it's excessive. Anyone to take it out a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all these things. So that to me is the most obvious one.\n\nAnd obviously, government policy, if the government wants to do more FHA, they can do that. But that's up to them about where they want to cheap in mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that. But if they did anything like that, I would say, always do it really thoughtfully.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, first off, it's important to acknowledge that the housing market is a critical component of the overall economy and ensuring its health is vital. When it comes to the spread between mortgage rates and treasury yields, there are a few factors at play. The spread is influenced by a range of elements including risk premiums, credit risk, and the overall cost of processing and servicing loans.\n\nTo address the spread, there could be a few paths the administration might consider. Reducing regulatory burdens and costs associated with originating and servicing mortgages could help. This might involve simplifying some aspects of the regulatory framework, which could, in turn, lower costs for lenders and, ultimately, consumers.\n\nAnother consideration might be enhancing the liquidity in the mortgage-backed securities market to ensure there's a robust secondary market for these loans. This could help in narrowing the spread as well.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring that government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have clear and supportive policies could encourage lending and refinancing activities. This might involve looking at their role and how they can better support the market in a way that promotes stability and growth.\n\nUltimately, any action should be carefully considered to balance promoting growth and maintaining prudent lending standards to avoid unintended consequences. It’s all about finding that right mix to ensure a healthy, stable housing market that supports both new purchases and refinancing activities.",

      "question": "Very good. And as a follow-up, just speaking about regulators in general, there's obviously been a major change with this administration. Can you guys give us any color of what you're actually seeing on the ground. We're, what, 9 months or so into this new administration with the new regulators? And then also any color on when you think Basel III end game may come out and what you're hearing in terms of how it will compare to what the original proposal was in July of '23.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. And I just add the Dana number, they are doing that. They're looking at it holistically, that's great. But Dana number is right. I've said for years, G-SIB, CCAR, operational risk capital, double counting of the trading book, I mean it's just wrong. And some of these numbers are so inaccurate that they published that they should publish them with the disclosure saying, we know these are highly inaccurate like the CCAR test. We know that this is not remotely related to reality or stuff like that. So it's almost a dishonest disclosure of these things, like do the actual number.\n\nThe second thing they really should do, which I think they're doing is what is the intended effect and what's the unintended effect. So we talk about -- we've gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 public companies. We've gone from pushing mortgages out of the banking system to a huge buildup in parts of the nonbank institutions and a huge amount of arbitrage taking place. I was a regulator, I'd be looking at all that and say, my God, is that what I wanted. And the biggest frustration is they couldn't fixed all these things, reduce liquidity, reduce capital, all these things and made the system safer.\n\nSo we had a Silicon Valley Bank blow up because they're so focused on governance, they forgot to focus on interest rate exposure. And they are making changes that, like what is actually real risk banks are bearing as opposed to walk signaling on what a bank should be doing all the time. So hopefully, they'll do it. I think they're devoted to doing it. Like look at their words and their speeches, I'm talking about the OCC, the Fed, the FDIC. So I think it's very good. Let's get it done quickly.",
      "generated_answer": "Right, so on the regulatory front, we're definitely seeing a shift with the new administration, as expected. It's important to note that while there are new faces in regulatory positions, the focus remains largely on ensuring financial stability and protecting consumers. We're actively engaging with regulators to understand their perspectives and to communicate the value we bring to the economy and our clients. We're committed to working constructively with them on all matters.\n\nRegarding Basel III, we're anticipating more clarity soon, but it's always a bit fluid with these things. The end game is likely to focus on capital requirements, risk-weighted assets, and possibly liquidity regulations. We're staying close to the discussions and are prepared to adapt as needed. The July 2023 proposals gave us some indication, but we're waiting for final guidelines to get a complete picture. We're ready to comply and ensure that we maintain our strong capital position and continue to serve our clients effectively.",

      "question": "My first one is for you, Jeremy. Under the category no good deed goes unpunished. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the expense outlook for '26. You mentioned that $100 billion could be a little low and that you're in the middle of the planning cycle. That would imply 4% growth year-over-year. Is that the sort of new normal labor rate inflation that we should assume at this point?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Erika, just add to that, medical, we spent $3 billion or so in medical. That's going to be up 10% next year. And so when you look at some of these things, and we know that already and maybe we think it actually might be up another 10% in 2027 for a whole bunch of different reasons. And that's one thing. The other thing about comp, I just want to point it out, there's normal inflation and pay-for-performance, all that. There's a lot of pressure on -- from other people who are paying people quite well, hedge funds, law firms, private equity, nonbank financial institutions, and we are going to pay our people competitively. That is sine qua non if you want to have a great company for the next 20 years.\n\nAnd so there's some of that, too. I'm not sure that it's going to change very much when you look at it but I would put in the back of your mind, too. It's probably good for you all to hear me say that. [ It will be true ] for research.",
      "generated_answer": "A: Look, we're in the process of finalizing our plans, and we want to make sure we're doing the right things for the long-term health of the company. The expense outlook is something we constantly evaluate, and it's influenced by a variety of factors, including the competitive environment, regulatory requirements, and our ongoing investments in technology and innovation. \n\nWe do expect some level of inflationary pressure, particularly in labor costs, and we're factoring that into our plans. But we also look for efficiencies and ways to optimize our operations. So while there might be some upward pressure, we're also very focused on maintaining our discipline around expenses and ensuring that we're investing wisely to support our growth and serve our clients effectively. \n\nUltimately, the focus is on delivering for our shareholders by making sure we're not just cutting costs for the sake of it, but investing in areas that will drive the business forward and generate sustainable returns. So I wouldn't necessarily say 4% growth is a new normal, but it's a reflection of the current environment and our strategic priorities.",

      "question": "I'll make sure to send this transcript to my boss. But the second question is actually for you, Jamie. You have always had a differentiated way of thinking about risk and a 2-part question for you. Number one, I feel like we don't even know what the right questions are to ask when it comes to NDFI exposure and risk, which is such a broad category. And so a 2-part question here. Number one, what would be the questions you think investors should ask when assessing NDFI exposure as it relates to future credit risk? And second, should investors be concerned about the SSFA accounting for RWAs in certain structures where you could lower the RWAs to NDFI exposures from 100% to something much lower?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Which SSFA?\n\nIs that insurance related.\n\nMaybe we take a crack and tell you a little bit more about it. We feel fairly comfortable with our exposure in that. But I think what you should do is -- I think when we have a downturn, this is the important thing, there will be a credit cycle. And we shouldn't be surprised. The credit card losses go up, middle market loss go up, everything gets worse in a downturn in credit. I do suspect -- I can't prove this, and I don't know because we don't know everyone's underwriting standards. Every now and we see what someone else is doing, we're surprised that their standards are not particularly good, but that's always been true. I suspect when there's a downturn, you will see higher than normal downturn type of credit losses in certain categories. I just suspect that.\n\nAnd so the other thing, which you can do, which I'm going to ask Mike Grub to do for me because I asked periodically, look at the pricing of BDCs and their publicly traded private credit facilities and do the homework. There are disclosures around that, and we do it. And so maybe we take just a crack at one point, laying out the different carriers of MBFIs and ones that might be concerning and ones that aren't concerning.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, thank you for the question. When assessing NDFI (Non-Depository Financial Institution) exposure, I think it's crucial for investors to focus on a few key questions. First, you should consider the quality and transparency of the financial reporting of these institutions. Are they providing clear and comprehensive disclosures? This is vital for understanding their risk profiles and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nSecond, evaluate the underlying business models of these NDFIs. What types of lending or financial activities are they involved in? Are they concentrated in any high-risk areas, such as subprime lending or other volatile sectors? Understanding their business models will help assess whether they are exposed to systemic risks that could impact their solvency or liquidity.\n\nThird, consider the regulatory environment. Are these institutions operating under robust regulatory oversight, or are they in jurisdictions with less stringent regulations? Regulatory frameworks significantly influence the risk profiles of financial institutions.\n\nRegarding your second question about the SSFA (Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach) and RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) for NDFI exposures, I would advise caution. While the SSFA can offer a lower capital charge for certain structured exposures, investors should be wary of any accounting treatment that significantly reduces RWAs without a corresponding decrease in actual risk. It’s important to ensure that capital adequacy reflects genuine economic risk, not just regulatory arbitrage. \n\nIn essence, investors should be vigilant about understanding the real risks embedded in these exposures and not rely solely on accounting measures that might paint a rosier picture than reality. Always ask whether the risk weightings are truly reflective of the underlying risks. At JPMorgan, we always strive to take a comprehensive view of risk, ensuring that our capital levels are appropriate for the risks we are taking.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "The fee comes in over a year and some of these rewards come into negative NII over a year.\n\nIt's one example of like really bad accounting.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. With the Sapphire refresh, we're seeing strong customer engagement and good additions to our cardholder base, which is always encouraging. When it comes to the impact on the card fees line and the card revenue rate, there are a few factors to consider.\n\nFirst, as you mentioned, there will be some impact from the amortization of rewards expenses, which can temporarily affect the card revenue rate. This is a normal part of the business as we bring on new cardholders and they begin to earn and redeem rewards. Over time, as these cardholders increase their spending, we expect to see a positive impact on both volume growth and the overall revenue rate.\n\nIt's important to remember that the initial costs associated with rewards and acquisition are investments in future growth. As cardholders integrate the Sapphire card into their spending habits, we anticipate increased transaction volumes, which will contribute to higher interchange fees and overall card revenue.\n\nIn terms of what leads the horse, so to speak, it's a combination of factors. We focus on acquiring high-quality customers and encouraging engagement through spending incentives. As these customers use the card more frequently, we see a natural lift in transaction volumes. This, in turn, supports revenue growth and drives improvements in the card revenue rate over time.\n\nOverall, while there might be some short-term fluctuations in the card revenue rate due to these factors, we're confident in the long-term strategy and the value that the Sapphire refresh brings to our card portfolio.",
