      "question": "Yes, good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence, but Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be -- the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players, given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of the ability of the banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward? And maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that banking -- the banking system should be a source of strength?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Everyone trades stocks in a different way. So, sentiment -- but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too.\n\nAnd I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the next month.\n\nAnd then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you see that.\n\nAnd anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is.\n\nI just also want to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion. And then, to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month -- three-quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stock will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. It's important to acknowledge both the potential challenges and the strengths of the banking system as we navigate through economic turbulence. As Jeremy mentioned, the banking system should indeed be a source of strength. This is because banks today are far more resilient than they were before the 2008 financial crisis. We've built up substantial capital and liquidity buffers, and our risk management practices have evolved significantly to better withstand economic shocks. \n\nThe market often reacts to sentiment and fear, but if you look at the fundamentals, you'll see that banks are in a strong position to support the economy. We are prepared to manage through a downturn by continuing to provide credit and liquidity to our clients, which is crucial for maintaining economic stability. \n\nThe potential economic turbulence we're talking about could stem from a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and interest rate movements. However, the diversified nature of our business allows us to adapt and respond to these challenges. We have experience navigating through uncertain times and are committed to meeting the needs of our clients while maintaining our financial strength.\n\nThe key is to remain cautious and prepared. We have the capital and the robust risk management frameworks necessary to handle a range of economic scenarios. This allows us to continue playing a critical role in supporting the economy, even as we face headwinds. So while the market may react to immediate concerns, our focus is on the long-term stability and health of the banking system and our ability to continue serving our clients effectively.",

      "question": "Okay, got it. And then, just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Just are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then, we have, depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that, but based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment and that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So -- but we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let me address that. When it comes to capital, our primary focus has always been on maintaining a robust and resilient balance sheet that can withstand a variety of economic scenarios. In times of macroeconomic uncertainty, our approach is to be prudent and deliberate in how we allocate capital. This includes a careful evaluation of our investment opportunities, ensuring that any deployment of capital is aligned with our long-term strategic goals and provides a satisfactory risk-adjusted return.\n\nRegarding buybacks, we have always taken a disciplined approach. While we recognize that our stock may look attractive when it's cheaper, we balance buybacks with other considerations such as potential future opportunities and maintaining a strong capital cushion. Buybacks are a tool we use when the time is right, and the capital isn't better deployed elsewhere to serve our clients or invest in our business.\n\nIn terms of our investment agenda, we remain committed to strategic investments that drive growth and enhance our competitive position, especially in areas like technology and expanding our footprint. However, we also recognize the need to be agile and adjust our plans based on the evolving economic landscape. \n\nIn summary, while we continue to focus on opportunities for growth and value creation, we do so with an eye on maintaining flexibility and strength in our capital position, particularly in uncertain macro environments. This allows us not only to weather any potential storms but also to seize opportunities as they arise.",

      "question": "Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US treasuries if those reforms are implemented? And just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some of the recent volatility?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. So, SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which has deep flaws in them, to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks. It's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change.\n\nThe reason to change some of these things is so banks -- the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't -- if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea, but every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So, they should make these changes.\n\nThe reason why is when you have very -- lot of volatile markets and very widespread and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks themselves. And anyway -- and we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate the markets, help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no -- basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thank you for the question. The proposed changes to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) are certainly relevant in the context of managing our balance sheet and interest rate exposure. If the SLR reforms are implemented, they could provide some relief and flexibility in managing our capital and liquidity. \n\nWhen it comes to purchasing U.S. treasuries, our approach is guided by a mix of economic conditions, market dynamics, and regulatory requirements. We always evaluate the risk-reward profile of holding treasuries in our portfolio. With the recent rate volatility, we're mindful of potential impacts on our balance sheet, particularly given the geopolitical uncertainties and shifts in global demand for treasuries.\n\nIn terms of managing rate risk holistically, we have a robust framework in place to assess and respond to interest rate movements. Our balance sheet is well-positioned with a significant amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets, which gives us the flexibility to adapt to changes in the rate environment. We continually monitor the yield curve and adjust our strategies accordingly, seeking to optimize our interest rate exposure while ensuring we maintain a strong liquidity position.\n\nOverall, we're committed to navigating these challenges prudently, leveraging our strong capital and liquidity positions to continue serving our clients effectively.",

      "question": "Very good. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads, that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system. And there should be -- and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. Look, when it comes to regulatory reform, it's always a bit of a mixed bag. With a new administration and new personnel at the helm, like Treasury Secretary Yellen and others, there is certainly an opportunity for fresh perspectives. However, it's important to remember that regulatory processes are complex and often influenced by a myriad of factors beyond just the individuals in charge.\n\nI think what we can hope for, and what we certainly advocate for, is a thoughtful examination of the current regulatory framework—one that truly considers the broader economic implications and the health of the financial system as a whole. My hope is that regulators will take into account the lessons from the past, especially from the recent crisis, and look at recalibrating some of the rules that may not make sense in today's environment. This includes looking at things like SLR, G-SIB buffers, and how we address operational risk capital.\n\nIt's not about rolling back necessary safeguards—those are important—but about ensuring that regulations are effective and allow banks to serve their critical role in supporting economic growth. We've seen how banks have been a source of strength during the recent crisis, and we want to continue to be able to do that. So, in terms of confidence, I think there's always room for optimism when there's a chance to engage in meaningful dialogue and reform, but we have to wait and see how things unfold. We will continue to make our case and work constructively with regulators to achieve the best outcomes for our clients, shareholders, and the broader economy.",

      "question": "Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you will have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates? Are the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs, is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all of that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him in the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with -- around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle, they're not going to be -- trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. It's a good one, and it touches on a lot of the current sentiment out there. We are indeed living through a period of heightened macro uncertainty, and it’s important to recognize the complexity of the factors at play.\n\nWhen I talk to corporate CEOs and clients, the primary concerns are around clarity and stability. The uncertainty around tariffs, trade policies, and geopolitical tensions have significant implications for supply chains, investment decisions, and overall business confidence. A 90-day pause on tariffs is certainly a step in the right direction, but it's more of a temporary relief than a long-term solution. What businesses are really looking for is a clear and consistent policy framework that they can plan around.\n\nBeyond that, there is a need for constructive dialogue between major economies to address trade imbalances and other issues in a way that supports global growth. Businesses thrive on predictability, and policy uncertainty can dampen investment and hiring decisions. So, a clear path forward with regard to trade policies, combined with a broader commitment to fostering a stable business environment, would go a long way toward restoring confidence.\n\nIn addition, I think it’s crucial for the administration to focus on the fundamentals that drive economic growth, such as infrastructure investment, workforce development, and innovation. By addressing these areas, we can create a more resilient and competitive economy that can withstand external shocks.\n\nUltimately, businesses are adaptable, and they will find ways to navigate through challenges. But having a clear roadmap and a supportive policy environment makes that journey much smoother. That’s what we’re hearing from our clients, and it’s something I believe is achievable with thoughtful leadership and collaboration.",

      "question": "Got it. And I guess, as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of week. Just your comfort level in terms of the functioning of the treasury market? Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Any color would be great.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you, I don't think that's going to go away and that relates to that. Obviously, the US dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed -- we've been consistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently it happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened, that will happen and then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we don't know if and when that's going to happen and we'll see.\n\nBut the notion that the 10-year treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, we have huge global deficits back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter, tariffs, at least our economists think, will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So, we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, I think it's important to acknowledge that the treasury market is the backbone of the global financial system, and any significant volatility there is a cause for concern. The recent moves in the 10-year yield certainly reflect a lot of uncertainty in the market about the economic outlook and the future path of monetary policy. \n\nAs for the Fed stepping in, they have a range of tools at their disposal, including pausing QT or even reinitiating treasury purchases if they deem it necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the markets. We saw during the pandemic how quickly and effectively they can act to stabilize the financial system. \n\nHowever, it's also crucial for market participants to understand that these tools are not without their consequences. The Fed has to balance the need for market stability with its long-term objectives, including controlling inflation and maintaining employment levels. \n\nAs for our position, JPMorgan is well-prepared to navigate these fluctuations. We manage our balance sheet with a long-term view, and we are well-capitalized to handle periods of volatility. We continue to focus on serving our clients and maintaining our role as a port in the storm during uncertain times.",

JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated resilience and robust growth in the first quarter of 2025, with net income rising by 9% year-over-year to $14.6 billion and an EPS of $5.07, reflecting a 14% increase. We've maintained a strong ROE of 18%, and our total net revenue increased by 8% to $45.3 billion, driven by both net interest income and noninterest revenue growth.\n\nOur performance this quarter was bolstered by strategic initiatives, including a significant gain from the First Republic acquisition. Our diversified business model continues to serve us well, with strong contributions from our Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management segments.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on strategic growth through investments in technology and expanding our client base.

      "question": "Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive -- as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "I'll just also say that it may not be deposits, it may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen, which is different, is not the risk-off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.",
      "generated_answer": "A: Absolutely, we've seen a significant increase in deposits, particularly as corporates and investors have moved more towards cash during this period of volatility. In March and April, we observed a notable influx of deposits, largely driven by a combination of factors including the drawdown of revolvers by corporations, government stimulus payments, and an overall flight to safety given the uncertain economic environment. This trend has been consistent across both our consumer and wholesale banking segments.\n\nFor corporates, the initial reaction was to shore up liquidity, which led to revolver drawdowns and increased cash holdings. Many of those same corporates have subsequently issued bonds to term out some of that short-term borrowing, which has also contributed to the deposit growth as the proceeds initially sit on balance sheets.\n\nOn the consumer side, the fiscal stimulus measures, including direct deposits from the government, have also played a significant role in the increase in deposits. Customers have been more cautious with their spending, leading to higher savings rates and, consequently, higher deposit balances.\n\nIt's important to highlight that this influx of deposits provides us with a strategic advantage in terms of liquidity and capital flexibility, allowing us to continue supporting our clients through lending and other financial services. However, we remain mindful of the fact that, as the economy stabilizes and markets normalize, we might see some of these deposits flow back out, especially as corporates deploy cash for growth initiatives or as consumer spending patterns adjust. We are prepared to manage these dynamics proactively, ensuring that we maintain a strong liquidity position throughout.",

And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Again, almost impossible to answer. We look at all the cycles. We prepare for a full range of outcomes. So, not -- I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold, but I do -- I pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months. So, maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that.\n\nBut it's -- the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down. It looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know. But we are -- I've been quite cautious and you can see it in our capital, liquidity, our position, our balance sheet, and so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. It's always a challenge to directly compare one economic cycle to another, given the unique set of variables at play each time. However, there are certainly elements of past cycles that can offer some insights into what we might expect going forward.\n\nIn this particular environment, we're dealing with a number of factors that make it somewhat distinct. We've had significant fiscal and monetary stimulus, supply chain disruptions, and of course, the ongoing impact of the pandemic, which are all playing a role in shaping economic outcomes. If we look back, there are aspects of the early 2000s and post-2008 recovery periods that might offer some parallels, particularly the importance of consumer behavior and government intervention in stabilizing the economy.\n\nHowever, one thing that stands out today is the potential for higher inflation, which we haven't really seen in recent cycles. This is something that we're keeping a close eye on, and it could influence how central banks respond, potentially leading to a quicker adjustment in interest rates than we've seen in past recoveries.\n\nAs always, we're preparing for a range of outcomes. We know there will be ups and downs, and our focus remains on serving our clients and managing risk prudently. While there are uncertainties, the fundamentals of the economy remain strong, and we're well-positioned to navigate whatever comes next.",

We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean, and I -- the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change we've never seen in our lives.",
      "generated_answer": "Sure, let me try to address that based on our current outlook and performance.\n\nThank you for the question. First, let me say that we're proud of how JPMorgan Chase has navigated the challenging environment so far. Our robust performance in the first quarter of 2025, with a 9% increase in net income year-over-year, underscores our resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. This is a testament to our diversified business model and disciplined risk management.\n\nLooking at the broader landscape, I think it's important to acknowledge the role that banks, including JPMorgan Chase, have played as a stabilizing force in these turbulent times. As you mentioned, during this crisis, banks have stepped up significantly, not just in supporting clients and employees but also in facilitating government initiatives like the PPP. We've been able to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions while continuing to lend and support the communities we serve.\n\nNow, regarding the future, we remain vigilant. The economic recovery is underway, but it's uneven, and there are still uncertainties, such as potential interest rate movements and regulatory developments. We're prepared for a range of outcomes, and our focus is on staying close to our clients, understanding their needs, and continuing to deliver on our strategic priorities, including disciplined expense management and strategic investments that drive growth.\n\nOverall, I believe we're well-positioned to navigate any headwinds that might come our way and continue to create value for our shareholders while supporting our clients and communities. As always, we'll remain flexible and ready to adapt as the economic landscape evolves. Thank you.",

      "question": "Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a \"deep recognition of flaws\" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put -- you or Jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid as much as red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you'd pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation?\n\nBut before that, the negative which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman letter about the trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars \"get over it\" to this week say \"do something.\" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened? And do you really think next earnings call will be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about to \"get over it,\" I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it.\n\nYou may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade. So -- and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of -- obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about \"get over it.\" I did not change my view about it.\n\nI would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too. Maybe the extent they want to do it, they said they're having conversations with 70 or 80 different people. And so, I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system.\n\nAnd I don't -- I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see, okay? There will be thousands -- hundreds of people maybe, but it's not going to be [passed on] (ph), but it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages if it's done right.\n\nI specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing that right now.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. Let's start with the regulatory environment and potential for streamlining. When I talk about recognizing flaws in the regulatory regime, I'm referring to the need for a more balanced approach. We need to maintain the safety and soundness of the financial system while avoiding unnecessary complexity and red tape that doesn't contribute to those goals. By simplifying and recalibrating the rules—especially those that overlap or have unintended consequences—we could see meaningful cost savings. The efficiencies gained would not only benefit banks like ours but could also translate into better pricing and services for customers. It’s hard to quantify exactly, but reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens could potentially save billions across the industry, which we would aim to reinvest in technology and customer service, and yes, some of that would be passed on to shareholders in the form of improved returns.\n\nAs for trade wars, my stance has evolved as we've seen the impact unfold. Initially, I suggested we \"get over it\" because I believed businesses could adapt to some tariffs and trade disruptions in the short term. However, the prolonged nature and the uncertainty surrounding these trade tensions have made their impact more significant than anticipated. It's affecting global supply chains, business investment decisions, and overall economic sentiment. So when I say \"do something,\" I'm emphasizing the need for clear, decisive actions to resolve these trade disputes. It's essential for business confidence and stability. I hope by the next earnings call, we'll have more clarity, but as always, we need to prepare for continued volatility and be ready to manage through it.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "If you do all -- if you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%. And the reason for that isn't -- it's not just capital. It is also LCR. It is also G-SIFIs.\n\nAnd the question you should ask, because you are very smart, Mike, is could you -- have the same -- and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to the First Republic of Silicon Valley, and you can accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nYou can read our -- I think our [MPRs] (ph) are public and stuff like that. And so, they should do that, just make a better system. We have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. And if you don't -- I'd say, when you look at these rules and regulations, see Europe. If that's where we want to go, let's just go there.",
      "generated_answer": "Absolutely. Let me clarify that. When we talk about capital, it's important to remember that banks like JPMorgan are holding significant capital buffers right now. If we were to reduce our CET1 ratio by just a fraction, say one-fifth, that could potentially free up hundreds of billions of dollars in lending capacity. This isn't just about deploying capital for the sake of it; it's about being able to support our clients and the broader economy more effectively. \n\nIn a world where we can manage risks appropriately, having that additional lending capacity means we can provide more financing to businesses and consumers, driving economic growth. But of course, this has to be balanced with maintaining our fortress balance sheet. We wouldn't do anything that compromises our financial stability or our ability to weather future storms. \n\nThe regulators have done a great job ensuring the financial system is sound and resilient, but as we look to the future, there's room for thoughtful recalibration. We want to make sure we're not over-constraining the banking system and thus the economy. We stand ready to engage in constructive dialogue on how best to achieve that balance.",

They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international US company during trade wars, and I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers, so how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us, but I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and we'll just have to deal with that.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. When it comes to the complexities of operating as an international company amid the backdrop of trade tensions, I want to emphasize that JPMorgan Chase's global footprint is both a strategic advantage and a responsibility. We have operations in over 100 countries, and this gives us the unique ability to serve clients across borders, provide global insights, and support international trade and investment.\n\nHowever, we must navigate geopolitical tensions and trade disputes carefully. These tensions can introduce uncertainties that impact global markets and economic growth, and as a diversified financial institution, we need to be agile in managing these risks. This involves continuous scenario planning and maintaining strong relationships with regulators and governments worldwide.\n\nAs for how we approach these risks, we remain committed to supporting our clients, regardless of geopolitical challenges. We focus on providing the best advice and solutions to help them navigate through these complexities. We also prioritize maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions to withstand any potential shocks that may arise from geopolitical developments.\n\nMoreover, we believe in the importance of open dialogue and collaboration with policymakers. We actively engage in discussions with governments and industry leaders to advocate for policies that promote economic stability and growth. Our aim is to be a constructive partner in addressing challenges and finding solutions that benefit both our clients and the broader global economy.\n\nIn terms of trade wars, while they can create temporary disruptions, I am optimistic about the resilience of global trade and the adaptability of businesses. History has shown that economies eventually find ways to adjust, and we are here to support our clients through those transitions.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that our commitment to communities and customers remains steadfast. We continue to invest in the regions we serve, supporting local economies, and fostering inclusive growth. This commitment helps ensure that we remain a trusted partner, even during times of uncertainty.",

      "question": "Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree flawed regulatory system could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are you -- are the systems better? Are they better able to handle it as your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy -- I agree with Jeremy. I'd add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid/ask spreads that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes, so you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps and a whole bunch of different things, treasuries, that's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you're seeing in DCM today, when you don't have bond deals, when you have less trading, when you have -- so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients. So, we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads go up or down and pretty bad.\n\nBut the plumbing of the system, I would say, the plumbing worked well during COVID, too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and it wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had. So -- but you're always worried about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",
      "generated_answer": "Thanks for the question. First off, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous effort and capability of our people across the firm. We have some of the best risk management teams in the business, and they've been doing an outstanding job navigating these volatile markets. Our results reflect not just the diversity of our platform but also the depth of talent we have in risk management and trading. \n\nNow, regarding the regulatory environment and market plumbing, it's true that there have been significant improvements since the financial crisis. The systems are indeed more robust, and that's partly due to the regulatory changes that have been implemented over the past decade. Capital and liquidity requirements have made the system more resilient, and we've seen those benefits play out in the current environment. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all volatility is beneficial. Extreme volatility can stress systems and reveal underlying vulnerabilities, and we need to remain vigilant. Our technology and processes are continuously being updated and stress-tested to ensure they can handle a range of scenarios, and we're always looking for ways to improve. \n\nAs for the regulatory system, yes, there are areas that could be recalibrated to better reflect current market realities. This is an ongoing conversation, and we should be open to making adjustments that support a healthy and competitive banking system. Overall, I think the combination of improved systems, talented people, and a regulatory framework that continues to evolve has helped us manage through this period effectively.",

      "question": "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess, how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts? If you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn, I think you do have -- in the $95 billion guidance, you do have good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you -- does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments or do you think that's just completely short sighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "As you said management thing, because I think it's very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses, and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off. And -- but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can imagine -- if you go to -- if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail.\n\nAnd so, there is -- we're making a -- I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID, the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the -- and Mike Mayo mentioned the thing about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit.\n\nI mean, we -- I pointed out resolution recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long, okay? It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long, okay? We report 1 trillion -- I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the -- all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we -- that hopefully we can get rid of and reduce the cost of the system and -- but it's not new branches. So, the folks here are working on, we call, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that. So -- and we're having fun doing it. It's like -- to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so -- and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.",
      "generated_answer": "Thanks for the question. At JPMorgan, our approach to costs and investments is always strategic and long-term oriented. Even in periods of revenue slowdown, we maintain our commitment to investing in our business for the future. This includes investments in technology, branches, bankers, and marketing, which are critical for our growth and competitiveness.\n\nWe don't typically pull back on strategic investments just because of short-term revenue pressures unless there's a significant downturn that would fundamentally alter the landscape. These investments are not just about immediate returns; they're about positioning the firm for sustained success over the long run. It's important to remain agile, but also to be prudent and continue to build our capabilities, even during challenging times.\n\nOf course, we always keep a close eye on the efficiency and effectiveness of our spending, ensuring that we are making smart, disciplined decisions. If there were significant changes in the broader economic environment or our outlook, we'd reassess our priorities, but our focus is on maintaining our strategic direction and preparing for future opportunities.",

      "question": "Jamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to?\n\nAnd secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Chris, just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture, so nothing has happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that.\n\nAnd then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing.\n\nAnd how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for America? And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.",
      "generated_answer": "Okay, so first of all, when considering financial deregulation, I would urge a bit of caution. While there may be optimism in some quarters about deregulation potentially benefiting banks, it's important to understand that any regulatory changes are typically complex and can take time to implement. The landscape is shaped by a variety of factors, including political, economic, and social considerations. \n\nThat being said, there could be areas where we might see some recalibration or adjustment to existing regulations. For instance, there might be discussions around capital requirements, liquidity rules, or other regulatory measures that were put in place post-crisis. However, I wouldn't speculate too much on specifics until we see concrete proposals or changes being enacted.\n\nAs for the second part of your question on capital, our primary goal is to support our clients and grow our business sustainably. We have a strong capital position and are continually evaluating the best uses for that capital. This includes investing in our businesses, maintaining a steady dividend, and returning excess capital to shareholders through buybacks when it makes sense. \n\nTiming-wise, we're always looking at the macroeconomic environment, regulatory developments, and market conditions. We want to ensure that we are in the best position to serve our clients and support economic growth while also providing strong returns to our shareholders. So, we'll be patient and thoughtful about any capital decisions, always keeping in mind the long-term interests of our stakeholders.",

We are always on the lookout for areas where we can strengthen our competitive position and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

And -- but I do think you have fintech, these guys are very smart. I'm trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts to get the payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved. We're going to be in it and learning a lot and player.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for that question. Stablecoins have been a topic of significant interest and debate, and they represent both an opportunity and a challenge for the traditional banking industry. At JPMorgan, we have always been at the forefront of innovation and technology, and we see stablecoins as an important development in the financial ecosystem.\n\nStablecoins, by design, are intended to provide stability relative to other cryptocurrencies, and they are often pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. They offer a fast and efficient means of transferring value and can facilitate more seamless transactions across borders, which is something we've been actively working on with our own blockchain initiatives.\n\nAt JPMorgan, we've developed the JPM Coin, a digital token that is backed by U.S. dollars and is used to facilitate instantaneous payments between institutional clients. This is part of our broader strategy to leverage blockchain technology to improve efficiencies in the financial system. The JPM Coin represents a step towards digitizing the movement of money, and it serves as a prototype for how stablecoins can be used within a regulated banking environment.\n\nAs for the JPMD deposit token, it is another example of our commitment to innovation. This token is designed to provide a secure and efficient way to handle digital transactions, and it complements our existing suite of payment solutions. We believe that offering a variety of digital payment options will be crucial in meeting the evolving needs of our clients.\n\nIn terms of competition, we welcome the challenge. We are confident that our strong regulatory compliance, robust risk management, and technological capabilities position us well to compete in this space. However, it's important to note that stablecoins, like any other financial product, need to be properly regulated to ensure transparency, security, and consumer protection.\n\nIn summary, while stablecoins present a new dynamic in the financial landscape, JPMorgan is actively engaging with this technology to enhance our service offerings and to ensure that we remain a leader in the payments space. We're committed to exploring and implementing innovative solutions that benefit our clients and the financial system as a whole.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "So this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer. So we think the customer has the right to, if they want to share their information. What we asked people to do is, what are they -- do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It should be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because somebody of these things going on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so we're kind of in favor of all that done properly.\n\nAnd then the payment, it just -- it costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system protection.

      "question": "This almost sounds like a fintech and AI call. But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release, give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the U.S., what's the state of play there? When we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing, should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out 6, 9, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that we all look at?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "You can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We've built, I think 500 bank of the innovation economy, which is kind of new to us. I think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business, regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next 6 to 9 months.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let's delve into the current state of the middle market businesses in the U.S. In the press release, we emphasized the strength and resilience of these businesses, which continue to navigate a complex landscape marked by fluctuating interest rates, tariff implications, and consumer spending trends.\n\nFirstly, middle market businesses are generally in good shape. They have been benefiting from an overall strong economic backdrop, which has been supportive despite some headwinds. Interest rates, which are currently at relatively low levels, continue to provide a favorable borrowing environment for these businesses. This has allowed them to access capital at lower costs, which is essential for growth and expansion.\n\nHowever, we must acknowledge the potential challenges that could arise. Tariffs and trade tensions are areas that could impact certain sectors more than others, particularly those reliant on international supply chains. It's important to keep an eye on how these factors evolve and their potential trickle-down effects on these businesses.\n\nOn the consumer spending front, while there is some concern about a potential slowdown, it's crucial to note that consumer balance sheets have generally been strong. The savings rate remains elevated, and employment trends have been favorable, which supports consumer activity. However, any significant downturn in consumer confidence or spending could have a ripple effect on middle market businesses, which are often closely tied to consumer demand.\n\nRegarding credit quality, we are not currently seeing any significant stress in the middle market segment. Credit metrics remain robust, and we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to underwriting standards. That said, we are vigilant and continue to monitor the landscape for any changes that could impact credit quality. We are prepared to take prudent actions if we begin to see signs of deterioration.\n\nIn summary, while there are areas to watch, the overall health of middle market businesses is strong, supported by a conducive economic environment. We remain cautiously optimistic but are prepared to navigate any challenges that may arise.",

      "question": "Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography?\n\nAnd Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And to answer your other question, Mike. So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second.\n\nSo G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and stuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book.\n\nAnd when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. Regarding commercial loan growth in the second quarter, we observed a notable uptick driven by increased demand from businesses as they geared up for a more robust economic recovery. This growth is relatively broad-based, but we’ve seen particular strength in regions and sectors that are rebounding more quickly from the pandemic disruptions. For example, areas with a strong presence in technology and manufacturing have seen heightened activity. Additionally, companies are leveraging historically low interest rates to invest in expansion projects and shore up their liquidity, which has also contributed to the growth.\n\nAs for the regulatory angle, there's a lot that can be done to encourage banks to lend more. One key aspect is ensuring that capital and liquidity requirements are aligned with the actual risk environment. I've often talked about the need to recalibrate certain regulatory measures, like the G-SIFI and SLR, which could be more reflective of current market conditions and economic realities. By adjusting these frameworks, we could unlock more capital for productive lending without compromising safety and soundness. Additionally, fostering a more streamlined regulatory process that reduces unnecessary complexity and encourages innovation would further support lending activities. This would not only aid banks but also help meet the Treasury Secretary's goal of boosting lending and supporting economic growth.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, and I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things can reduce the actual cost of making loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we've just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, there's always potential for streamlining the process of making a loan. At JPMorgan Chase, we're continuously looking at ways to enhance efficiency and reduce costs through technology and process improvements. The cost to make a loan can be significant, involving underwriting, compliance, and servicing, among other factors. By leveraging technology, such as AI and machine learning, we can automate parts of the loan origination and servicing processes, reducing both time and expense.\n\nAdditionally, digitizing the customer experience, whether through mobile apps or online platforms, can make the process more seamless for both the customer and the bank.

But you might -- your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us, natural fit being product and people and culture.",
      "generated_answer": "In the context of discussing \"peak private credit,\" I'm referring to the rapid growth and expansion of private credit markets over recent years. This growth has been fueled by investors seeking yield in a low-interest-rate environment and the desire for more flexible lending solutions that traditional banks might not always provide. Private credit has been a crucial alternative source of financing, especially as banks have faced increased regulatory constraints post-2008.\n\nHowever, the term \"peak\" suggests that we need to be cautious about the sustainability of this trajectory. There's a concern that the rapid growth in private credit might be reaching its zenith, potentially leading to heightened risks. These risks could include increased leverage, the quality of underwriting, and exposure to sectors that might be more vulnerable in an economic downturn. Additionally, as interest rates rise or market conditions change, the dynamics that have supported the growth of private credit could shift, leading to potential challenges in refinancing or liquidity.\n\nWe should be mindful of these factors and ensure that we are effectively managing the risks associated with private credit, both within our own operations and in the broader financial ecosystem.

      "question": "Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "In a competitive world, it is irrational to thing that -- and when it applies to all the competitors that everyone is just going to make a lot more money to keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.\n\nAnd Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. Now they should do a low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff, if you didn't do, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns. That we just -- we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches, that does our private bank or things like that.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. First off, I want to say that any simplification in the regulatory construct is a welcome development. We've been navigating a complex web of regulations for quite some time now, and a more streamlined approach could certainly improve our ability to serve clients efficiently and effectively.\n\nNow, in terms of its impact on ROTCE, if we do indeed see a regulatory environment that is more rationalized and that appropriately calibrates capital and liquidity requirements, it could certainly have a positive impact on our returns. A more optimized denominator, if you will, would allow us to deploy capital more strategically across our businesses, potentially enhancing our ability to generate higher returns. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the competitive landscape will dictate how much of that benefit we can retain versus what might get passed on to clients. In a highly competitive market, some of those efficiency gains could be shared with clients through better pricing or enhanced services. \n\nThat said, our focus remains on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ensuring we are well-positioned to support our clients through various economic cycles. The 17% ROTCE target through the cycle remains our benchmark, and we believe it's a very healthy return. But, of course, any regulatory adjustments that allow us to optimize capital without compromising our risk management framework could provide upward potential to that target.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to serve our clients well, grow the business responsibly, and provide sustainable returns to our shareholders. And we will continue to do so, regardless of the regulatory environment.",

And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement.\n\nAnd the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly, we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it -- does activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels, or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you might want to -- I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. And so that lesson we've learned over and over, it may stay wide open for 1.5 years. Something may happen geopolitically that all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yes, you're going to have really active markets.\n\nI do think that extending the tax bill for business to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done.\n\nI also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial Liberation Day, now there's more talk as more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed, that reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. When we look at the pickup in activity levels late in the quarter, it's important to recognize that markets and sentiment are often responsive to shifts in perceived risk and uncertainty. In this case, we did see some alleviation of concerns around extreme outcomes related to tariff policies, and that certainly helped. It provided a bit more clarity and stability, which markets always appreciate.\n\nThe passage of the tax bill and the more certain fiscal landscape also played a role in bolstering sentiment, as it removed a layer of uncertainty that was weighing on the minds of businesses and investors. While these factors have contributed to a more favorable environment, it's crucial to remember that markets are dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors, both domestic and global.\n\nFor the second half of the year, while some headwinds have been reduced, we must remain vigilant to other potential risks and uncertainties that could emerge. Factors like geopolitical tensions, shifts in monetary policy, and broader economic indicators will continue to influence client behavior and market activity. But overall, we're cautiously optimistic about maintaining this momentum as long as the environment remains supportive.\n\nIn terms of client thinking, while some issues have been addressed, there are always new challenges on the horizon. Our job is to stay close to our clients, understand their needs, and help them navigate through both the opportunities and risks that lie ahead. And as always, we'll continue to focus on serving our clients well, leveraging our capabilities to support them in achieving their strategic objectives.",

      "question": "Okay. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators looked at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks, or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheet into lower-risk assets. Do you see that -- is it really just a supply issue? Or how do you think about the demand/supply dynamic? And is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower-margin areas? Just your thoughts.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And I'm like a broken record. It's not SLR, it's LCR, it's G-SIFI, it's CCAR, it's Basel IV, the gold-plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, et cetera. And even how you measure liquidity, which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery. They should look at all of that. If they really want to fix the system.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, and thank you for the question. The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) relief that regulators provided was indeed intended to offer banks more flexibility in managing their balance sheets, particularly in response to the unique challenges posed by the current environment. By not counting certain assets, like central bank reserves and Treasury securities, against the leverage ratio, the idea is to give banks the room to absorb more deposits and support lending without facing undue capital constraints.\n\nNow, when we look at the dynamics of demand and supply, it's important to recognize that the demand side is influenced by many factors, including the broader economic environment and business confidence. While we have seen significant liquidity in the system and strong issuance in the capital markets, the demand for credit in certain sectors remains subdued, particularly in light of ongoing economic uncertainties.\n\nFrom a supply perspective, banks have ample capacity to lend, and we are equipped with strong capital and liquidity positions. The relief on the SLR front does provide us with additional room to maneuver, but we also need to be prudent in how we deploy capital. We must ensure that any expansion in our balance sheet aligns with our risk appetite and delivers appropriate returns.\n\nIn terms of opportunities, yes, there are areas where we can look to grow, albeit with a disciplined approach. This includes expanding in areas where there is a viable risk-adjusted return, whether it be in traditional lending, supporting businesses as they navigate through this period, or in areas like digital and payments where we continue to see strong demand.\n\nUltimately, our strategy is to remain focused on serving our clients effectively, managing our risks carefully, and ensuring that we are well-positioned to support economic recovery as it unfolds. The SLR relief is a tool that helps us in this endeavor, but our broader outlook and actions are always guided by a comprehensive assessment of market conditions and opportunities.",

      "question": "I just wanted to ask about any pressure from Commercial and Corporate customers to try to offset the tariff impact from regional banks have pointed to deposit pricing pressure on the commercial side, and if you're seeing any signs of that or more broadly speaking?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "What's the tariff pressure with pressure on loans or debt. The answer is no.\n\nNo, I mean. There's always pressure in some of those.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. When it comes to the impact of tariffs and how they might affect our commercial and corporate clients, we're certainly keeping a close eye on the situation. What we're seeing is that businesses are adapting to the current environment, and that's always been a hallmark of resilient companies. As far as deposit pricing pressure is concerned, particularly from regional banks, it's important to remember that we operate in a very competitive landscape, and that's not new for us.\n\nOur relationships with commercial clients are built on a lot more than just pricing; they're built on trust, the breadth of services we offer, and our ability to provide solutions that help them grow and manage their businesses effectively. We continue to engage actively with our clients, understanding their challenges and working with them to find tailored solutions, whether that's through cash management, lending, or providing strategic advice.\n\nIn terms of deposit pricing, yes, there's always going to be some competition there, but our focus remains on delivering value and comprehensive solutions that go beyond just the rates we offer. It's about the totality of what JPMorgan Chase can provide—our global reach, our technology, our people—and that's an advantage that we're always working to enhance.",

      "question": "Just two quick follow-ups. On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines. I know we've been here before and markets can give us and take it away. But there is a time value in there, meaning corporates, and more importantly sponsors, need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if that -- if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time? We've been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now. Does it -- is it feel more doable as long as the market doesn't take the rug out from under us?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "I think it separate sponsor-owned companies from IPOs. There are companies going public. They're in the pipeline. They want to go public, et cetera. Sponsors are still, at least from what I can tell, anecdotally still reluctant to use the public markets. There may obviously be maybe more of it, but it hasn't been a mount of stuff coming out.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, there is a sense of optimism in the air, and the robust pipelines we're seeing are reflective of that. The market dynamics have shifted somewhat, and there's a palpable urgency among corporates and sponsors to execute on their plans. The dry powder that private equity firms are sitting on is indeed a significant factor, and there's a strong desire to put that capital to work. \n\nOf course, we have to be mindful of the fact that markets are inherently volatile and can change course rapidly. However, the conversations we're having with clients suggest a higher level of confidence and readiness to move forward with transactions. The key here is that the fundamental drivers remain intact, and barring any significant market disruptions, we are well-positioned to see these pipelines materialize into tangible outcomes. \n\nOur teams are actively engaged with clients to ensure we can capitalize on these opportunities as they arise, and we're committed to providing the resources and support needed to execute effectively. So, while we remain cautious, we're also prepared to seize the moment, and there's a sense that this time around, the momentum may indeed be more sustainable.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Reserve the right. We're not going to tell you. But obviously, the stock pricing -- I mean I don't like buying back the stock at almost 3x tangible book. No one is going to convince me that's a brilliant thing to do, but it is wise to use our balance sheet for customers, which we're doing. And we can maybe possibly do more. And it is probably wise to not increase the excess capital anymore since we have plenty, and it's going to be going up.\n\nBut look, I'm completely convinced if you take out of your mindset 12 months. We will use the capital wisely for shareholders.\n\nAnd the best way is organic growth, which I wouldn't rule out that we can find more ways to grow clients, basically.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, let me address that by saying, first and foremost, our approach to buybacks has always been consistent and disciplined. We buy back stock when we believe it offers good value, and we are always mindful of our capital position and future needs. As the stock price fluctuates, we continue to assess its intrinsic value relative to the market price. \n\nWhen the stock is high, we tend to buy less; when it's lower, we may be more aggressive. Our focus is on creating long-term shareholder value, not on meeting short-term market expectations. We are not committed to buying back stock at any cost; rather, we evaluate the broader market conditions, our capital needs, and alternative uses of our capital, such as strategic investments and organic growth opportunities.\n\nOur capital is in a strong position, and we have a lot of flexibility. We will continue to be prudent and opportunistic in how we deploy buybacks, always considering the best interests of our shareholders and the long-term growth of the firm. If the stock price seems inflated, we're not going to rush to buy back stock. We'll remain patient and strategic.",

      "question": "I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the onetime effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is.\n\nAnd if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was guidance -- guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some onetime -- not onetime items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially -- I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE, which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you can answer this one. I just might add really be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we cannot just earn 17% ROTCE is that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17% you're a bond, then you will trade at 3x tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing.\n\nIf you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers internationally. And when we look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe is it's been great. Innovation economy has been great. We're gaining shares in a lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the international -- payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that is the best way to use it.\n\nYou have all of our major bank competitors are back, rolling and expanding. Then you have the fintech folks, who are quite capable and quite smart, who you don't want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion is that somehow we're not going to deal with tough competitors, right, which protects JPMorgan Chase, if we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on realizing -- you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day.\n\nAnd so we're quite cautious to just declare victory, like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, because I had Jeremy do this number one point, if you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America -- for 40 years maybe.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, it's important to understand that our focus on maintaining a 17% ROTCE target is based on a through-the-cycle view. While we've seen a strong 20% ROTCE this quarter, it's crucial to recognize that this is influenced by a number of factors that may not be consistent over the long term.\n\nFirst, let's consider the environment we're in. We're benefiting from a favorable macroeconomic backdrop, including strong markets and consumer spending, which have positively impacted our results. However, these conditions are not permanent, and we have to be prepared for a range of potential economic scenarios. The 17% target is a reflection of our expectation of sustainable performance over the long term, accounting for both positive and negative economic cycles.\n\nSecond, while our business mix has evolved, and we've made significant investments in technology and expansion that have enhanced our profitability, the current environment has also provided certain tailwinds. These include a benign credit environment, robust fee income, and elevated trading revenues, which may not persist at the same levels indefinitely.\n\nFinally, it's important to consider our capital position. While we've increased our CET1 ratio guidance from 11.5%-12% to a higher level, this reflects a prudent approach to managing risk and ensuring we have the flexibility to navigate various economic conditions. The higher capital levels also provide a buffer that supports our ability to continue serving clients and investing in growth opportunities.\n\nIn summary, while we're pleased with our performance and confident in our strategic direction, the 17% ROTCE target remains a realistic and disciplined through-the-cycle goal, allowing us to be prepared for changing economic conditions and ensuring sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders.",

      "question": "If I could get an answer to this from both you, Jeremy, and Jamie, the question really is how much of a risk is the lending to the NDFIs? Just -- I mean, because you guys are always outfront highlighting what could happen, whether it's cyber or as you point, labor market or inflation. And I feel like you haven't really highlighted this as a potential risk area. Maybe that's because you don't perceive it as such, but you have Tricolor, you have First Brands. One area of your biggest growth, I think, has been NDFIs over the last year.\n\nSo I'm just trying to put this in some sort of context that as it relates to Tricolor, who bears the losses? Does end investors in the funds? Is it -- do you put skin in the game and have your own investments? Are you an underwriter? Where are you exposed? So I guess I'm asking JPMorgan specifically but then Jamie more generally for the industry. Is this something that's flashing yellow that you are spending more time on? How should we think about that?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. Mike, I would just add that it's a very large category of nonbank financial institutions and probably a number like half of it, we would consider very traditional, not like different. There is a component, which is different today than it was years ago, and there's a component which isn't that different. But if you look at like COs, CLOs and lending to leveraged entities that are underwritten with leveraged loans, so there's kind of a little bit of double leverage in there.\n\nI would say that, yes, there will be additional risk in that category that we will see when we have a downturn. I expect to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be because we don't know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did. Jeremy said these are very smart players. They know what they're doing. They've been around a long time but they're not all very smart. And we don't even know the standards that other banks underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that some of those standards may not be as good as you think. Hopefully, we are very good, though we make our mistakes, too, obviously.\n\nSo yes, I think you'd be a little bit worse. We've had a benign credit environment for so long that I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate a little bit more than people think when, in fact, there's a downturn. And hopefully, it will be a fairly normal credit cycle. What always happens is something is worse than a normal credit cycle than a normal downturn. So we'll see. But we think we're quite careful. And obviously, we scour the world looking for things that we should be worried about.\n\nBut I do remind people, we've had a bull market for a long time. Asset prices are high, a lot of credit stuff that you would see out there, you will only see when there's a downturn.",
      "generated_answer": "Thanks for the question. Let me start by addressing JPMorgan's specific exposure and then I'll touch on the broader industry perspective.\n\nAt JPMorgan, our lending to non-deposit financial institutions (NDFIs) is structured carefully to manage risk effectively. This involves a combination of underwriting standards, diversification, and robust risk management frameworks. In terms of entities like Tricolor and First Brands, our role can vary from being an underwriter to having some investment exposure. However, the primary risk is typically borne by the end investors in the funds rather than us holding substantial equity stakes. We ensure that we're not overexposed and that any lending is backed by solid collateral and rigorous due diligence processes.\n\nOn a broader industry level, while the growth of NDFIs is something to watch, I wouldn't say it's flashing yellow just yet. The financial ecosystem is evolving, and non-bank financial intermediaries are playing a larger role in credit markets. They often serve niche markets and provide liquidity where traditional banks may not, which can be beneficial for the overall financial system. However, we are mindful of potential risks, especially those related to underwriting standards and transparency.\n\nIt's crucial for banks like ours to maintain a disciplined approach to credit risk management and ensure we have proper oversight over these exposures. We continue to monitor the landscape closely and adjust our strategies to mitigate any emerging risks. Overall, while the rise of NDFIs does introduce new dynamics into the market, the key is to ensure that we are agile and prepared to respond to any changes in the risk environment.",

And we think we're okay in other stuff. But I -- my antenna goes up when things like that happen. And I probably shouldn't say this but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. And so we should -- everyone should be forewarn on this one. And first brands, I put in the same category. And there are a couple of other ones out that I've seen that I put in similar categories. So -- but we always look at these things, and we're not -- I'm nipping in. We make mistakes, too. So we'll see. There clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things. But that doesn't mean we can't improve our procedures.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. At JPMorgan Chase, we're always committed to learning from every experience, whether it's large or small.

This includes leveraging our robust data analytics and AI capabilities to improve decision-making and ensure that we're aligned with best practices and regulatory expectations.

      "question": "Jeremy, obviously, you guys are in the residential mortgage lending market, big players granted home lending. When you look at the revenue relative to banking and wealth management, obviously, it's not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be -- when they come out with comments, they follow up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessent has pointed out about a couple of months ago that he thinks there's a housing emergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is, what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the corresponding treasury yield, assuming the treasury yields don't go down. But what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower mortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity, of course, would pick up with that.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "So I'll take that one. First, on the supply side. I mean it's -- we know what it is. It's permitting, it's rules, it's local rules. It's how long it takes to get permits and build not my backyard, you can't build 2 stories in certain places. That's the supply side. The demand side -- and remember, don't always push homeownership. I was -- we made a huge mistake in the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I've been talking about it for years that they should focus on reducing requirements require and we think you reduce the cost of mortgages 30 to 40 basis points overall. without creating any additional risk. There is just excessive stuff put in place after the great financial crisis, which obviously demanded a response but it's excessive. Anyone to take it out a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all these things. So that to me is the most obvious one.\n\nAnd obviously, government policy, if the government wants to do more FHA, they can do that. But that's up to them about where they want to cheap in mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that. But if they did anything like that, I would say, always do it really thoughtfully.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. Housing is indeed a critical issue, and it's encouraging to see the administration recognizing the challenges in this area. The spread between mortgage rates and treasury yields can be influenced by several factors, and there are a few avenues that could be pursued to address this.\n\nFirstly, enhancing the securitization market for non-agency mortgages could help. A robust and efficient securitization market can provide liquidity to the mortgage market and help reduce costs, ultimately lowering mortgage rates. The regulatory framework around securitization could be revisited to ensure it supports market growth while maintaining appropriate safeguards.\n\nSecondly, streamlining the regulatory environment for mortgage origination and servicing can also play a role. Overly complex and costly regulatory requirements can contribute to higher costs that lenders might pass on to consumers. A thoughtful recalibration of these rules could reduce the friction and costs in the system, making it easier and cheaper for lenders to offer mortgages.\n\nAdditionally, addressing some of the operational and technological challenges in the mortgage process could improve efficiency and reduce costs. This could involve leveraging technology to streamline the underwriting and approval processes, making it easier and faster for consumers to secure mortgages.\n\nLastly, fostering competition in the mortgage market can also help. Encouraging new entrants and innovative business models can drive down costs and improve the overall efficiency of the market.\n\nOverall, a combination of regulatory adjustments, market enhancements, and technological advancements could help narrow that spread and make housing more accessible to more Americans. At JPMorgan Chase, we're committed to doing our part to support these efforts and serve our clients effectively in the housing market.",

Can you guys give us any color of what you're actually seeing on the ground. We're, what, 9 months or so into this new administration with the new regulators? And then also any color on when you think Basel III end game may come out and what you're hearing in terms of how it will compare to what the original proposal was in July of '23.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. And I just add the Dana number, they are doing that. They're looking at it holistically, that's great. But Dana number is right. I've said for years, G-SIB, CCAR, operational risk capital, double counting of the trading book, I mean it's just wrong. And some of these numbers are so inaccurate that they published that they should publish them with the disclosure saying, we know these are highly inaccurate like the CCAR test. We know that this is not remotely related to reality or stuff like that. So it's almost a dishonest disclosure of these things, like do the actual number.\n\nThe second thing they really should do, which I think they're doing is what is the intended effect and what's the unintended effect. So we talk about -- we've gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 public companies. We've gone from pushing mortgages out of the banking system to a huge buildup in parts of the nonbank institutions and a huge amount of arbitrage taking place. I was a regulator, I'd be looking at all that and say, my God, is that what I wanted. And the biggest frustration is they couldn't fixed all these things, reduce liquidity, reduce capital, all these things and made the system safer.\n\nSo we had a Silicon Valley Bank blow up because they're so focused on governance, they forgot to focus on interest rate exposure. And they are making changes that, like what is actually real risk banks are bearing as opposed to walk signaling on what a bank should be doing all the time. So hopefully, they'll do it. I think they're devoted to doing it. Like look at their words and their speeches, I'm talking about the OCC, the Fed, the FDIC. So I think it's very good. Let's get it done quickly.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. The regulatory landscape has indeed seen some shifts with the new administration, and we're actively engaging with regulators to stay aligned with any changes or new directives. With the new administration, there's been a noticeable focus on areas like climate risk, fair lending practices, and overall transparency in financial activities. These are areas where we're looking to be proactive and ensure we're not just compliant but setting the standard.\n\nAs for Basel III's endgame, the timing remains uncertain, but we're anticipating some clarity in the near future. The discussions have been ongoing, and the general expectation is that the final rules may be more aligned with international standards, though possibly with some adjustments to reflect the unique aspects of the U.S. financial system. We're closely monitoring these developments and preparing to adapt our strategies to meet any new requirements.

      "question": "My first one is for you, Jeremy. Under the category no good deed goes unpunished. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the expense outlook for '26. You mentioned that $100 billion could be a little low and that you're in the middle of the planning cycle. That would imply 4% growth year-over-year. Is that the sort of new normal labor rate inflation that we should assume at this point?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Erika, just add to that, medical, we spent $3 billion or so in medical. That's going to be up 10% next year. And so when you look at some of these things, and we know that already and maybe we think it actually might be up another 10% in 2027 for a whole bunch of different reasons. And that's one thing. The other thing about comp, I just want to point it out, there's normal inflation and pay-for-performance, all that. There's a lot of pressure on -- from other people who are paying people quite well, hedge funds, law firms, private equity, nonbank financial institutions, and we are going to pay our people competitively. That is sine qua non if you want to have a great company for the next 20 years.\n\nAnd so there's some of that, too. I'm not sure that it's going to change very much when you look at it but I would put in the back of your mind, too. It's probably good for you all to hear me say that. [ It will be true ] for research.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. As we're working through our planning cycle for 2026, it's important to note that we are still in the process of finalizing our expense outlook. The 4% growth you're referencing is indicative of the kind of inflationary pressures we're seeing across the board, particularly in terms of labor costs. \n\nHowever, I want to emphasize that our approach to managing expenses is not just about reacting to inflation but also about strategically investing in our business to drive growth and enhance our capabilities. This includes investments in technology, expanding our footprint, and continuing to serve our clients effectively. \n\nWe always aim to balance these investments with prudent cost management, ensuring we're making the right decisions for long-term shareholder value.

      "question": "I'll make sure to send this transcript to my boss. But the second question is actually for you, Jamie. You have always had a differentiated way of thinking about risk and a 2-part question for you. Number one, I feel like we don't even know what the right questions are to ask when it comes to NDFI exposure and risk, which is such a broad category. And so a 2-part question here. Number one, what would be the questions you think investors should ask when assessing NDFI exposure as it relates to future credit risk? And second, should investors be concerned about the SSFA accounting for RWAs in certain structures where you could lower the RWAs to NDFI exposures from 100% to something much lower?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Which SSFA?\n\nIs that insurance related.\n\nMaybe we take a crack and tell you a little bit more about it. We feel fairly comfortable with our exposure in that. But I think what you should do is -- I think when we have a downturn, this is the important thing, there will be a credit cycle. And we shouldn't be surprised. The credit card losses go up, middle market loss go up, everything gets worse in a downturn in credit. I do suspect -- I can't prove this, and I don't know because we don't know everyone's underwriting standards. Every now and we see what someone else is doing, we're surprised that their standards are not particularly good, but that's always been true. I suspect when there's a downturn, you will see higher than normal downturn type of credit losses in certain categories. I just suspect that.\n\nAnd so the other thing, which you can do, which I'm going to ask Mike Grub to do for me because I asked periodically, look at the pricing of BDCs and their publicly traded private credit facilities and do the homework. There are disclosures around that, and we do it. And so maybe we take just a crack at one point, laying out the different carriers of MBFIs and ones that might be concerning and ones that aren't concerning.",

I appreciate the opportunity to address this topic, which is indeed quite relevant in today's financial landscape.\n\nFirstly, when it comes to assessing the risks associated with Non-Depository Financial Institutions (NDFIs), investors should be asking about the nature and quality of the underlying assets, the leverage being employed, and the liquidity of these assets. It's important to understand the funding model of these institutions, their exposure to interest rate changes, and their ability to withstand market volatility. Transparency is key—investors should seek detailed disclosures about the risk management practices and stress testing results of these entities. You need to look at the structural integrity of the products they are involved in and consider counterparty risk, concentration risk, and the potential for rapid liquidity withdrawal under stress conditions.\n\nSecondly, regarding the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) for risk-weighted assets (RWAs), it is indeed a tool that can lower the capital requirements for certain exposures. Investors should be cautious and ensure they understand how these calculations are being applied. The key question is: does the SSFA appropriately reflect the economic risk involved? There should be a robust evaluation of whether the risk weights are justified, given the credit quality of the underlying assets and the economic environment. It's crucial to ensure that any reduction in RWAs through SSFA does not lead to an undercapitalization of the risks on the balance sheet.\n\nUltimately, while these tools and structures can be beneficial in optimizing capital, they must be used judiciously and transparently, with a strong governance framework in place to ensure that risks are adequately managed. At JPMorgan, we remain committed to maintaining a fortress balance sheet, ensuring that we are resilient through cycles, and managing our exposures prudently while adhering to regulatory standards.",

      "question": "Okay. I'll follow up on that. And secondly, with the Sapphire refresh, just assume that we're starting to see some of the awards amortization show in the card fees line and in the card revenue rate. So I'm just wondering if you could kind of walk us through that now that, that card is coming on and you mentioned good additions there. Just what do we have to think about in terms of what leads the horse in terms of card revenue rate and eventual volume growth and related benefits.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The fee comes in over a year and some of these rewards come into negative NII over a year.\n\nIt's one example of like really bad accounting.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, thank you for the question. With the Sapphire refresh, we're quite pleased with the traction we're seeing. The card is resonating well with consumers, and we're encouraged by the good additions. As you noted, there's a dynamic interplay between card revenue rate, rewards amortization, and the volume growth we're targeting.\n\nFirstly, on rewards amortization, as with any significant refresh or enhancement, there are upfront costs that we account for, which you'll see reflected in the card fees line. This is part of our strategy to offer competitive value to our clients and drive engagement, ultimately leading to sustained growth in card volumes.\n\nAs for the card revenue rate, while rewards amortization may impact it in the near term, the broader aim is to enhance customer loyalty and spending, which should bolster our revenue rate over time. We're focusing on volume growth, which is a critical component. Higher spending volumes lead to greater interchange and interest income, which helps offset the initial investment in rewards.\n\nIt's all about balancing the short-term costs with long-term gains. We expect that as customers engage more and utilize the card’s offerings, we'll see a positive impact on both revenue and profitability. We're committed to maintaining a disciplined approach, ensuring that our value proposition aligns with customer expectations and drives sustainable growth. Thank you.",

      "question": "Related to the 15% long-term national retail deposit market share, does your pricing need to be materially different from recent history? Or said another way, do you need to price a little bit more competitive to get that 4 points of improvement over time?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The retail branch system, as Jeremy said, deepening. But remember, it's better products, better services, more branches and better location, deepening with customer segmentation. If we do a good job in all that, then we hope to gain share. And I think we are doing a good job on that but that -- we have to deliver that for a year to get to 15%.\n\nFolks, thank you very much, for spending time with us. We'll talk to you all soon.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, achieving a long-term national retail deposit market share of 15% is an ambitious goal, and it's one that we're committed to pursuing strategically. However, it's important to note that our approach is not solely about pricing. While competitive pricing can play a role, the broader strategy involves a combination of factors.\n\nFirst and foremost, we focus on delivering exceptional customer service and a seamless digital experience. Our investments in technology, particularly in our mobile and online banking platforms, are designed to enhance the customer experience and make it easier for customers to manage their finances.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to expand our branch network to reach more customers. As we've discussed, being in 48 states allows us to serve more communities, and our branches are evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers, offering more advisory and less transactional services.\n\nIt's also about the breadth of products and services we offer. By integrating our offerings across consumer banking, credit cards, wealth management, and more, we can deepen relationships with our customers and provide them with comprehensive financial solutions.\n\nFinally, our brand strength and trust in the marketplace are critical components. Customers choose us not just for competitive rates but for the stability and reliability JPMorgan Chase is known for.\n\nIn summary, while pricing is a factor, our strategy to achieve a 15% market share is holistic, focusing on customer experience, product breadth, technological innovation, and strategic expansion.",
