      "question": "Yes, good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence, but Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be -- the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players, given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of the ability of the banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward? And maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that banking -- the banking system should be a source of strength?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Everyone trades stocks in a different way. So, sentiment -- but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too.\n\nAnd I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the next month.\n\nAnd then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you see that.\n\nAnd anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is.\n\nI just also want to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion. And then, to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month -- three-quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stock will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. The banking system is fundamentally in a very strong position today, and that includes JPMorgan. The capital and liquidity positions of banks have improved dramatically since the financial crisis a decade ago. We are well-capitalized, and the regulatory framework ensures that we are prepared to withstand economic turbulence. So when Jeremy mentions that the banking system should be a source of strength during periods of economic turbulence, he's highlighting that robust capital and liquidity buffers allow us to continue supporting clients and the broader economy through lending and other financial services, even in challenging times.\n\nNow, regarding the equity market's perception, it's important to recognize that market sentiment often reacts to short-term news and fears, which can lead to volatility. However, the underlying strength of the banking system means we are well-positioned to absorb potential increases in provisions if the economic environment becomes more difficult. We plan for a range of economic scenarios and maintain a conservative approach to risk management, which gives us the ability to navigate different economic conditions effectively.\n\nIn terms of the economy, we're facing a number of uncertainties, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and potential geopolitical risks. These could lead to economic turbulence, but the strong foundation of the banking system is designed to help mitigate these risks, providing stability and confidence to businesses and consumers alike. Our role is to continue serving our clients and supporting the economy through both favorable and adverse conditions, and we are well-equipped to do so.",

      "question": "Okay, got it. And then, just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Just are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then, we have, depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that, but based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment and that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So -- but we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. In terms of capital allocation, our primary focus has always been on maintaining a strong capital base to navigate through uncertain times while also ensuring we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. The current macroeconomic environment, with its inherent uncertainties, reinforces the importance of this balanced approach.\n\nOur priority is to invest in our business, which includes both organic growth and strategic acquisitions that align with our long-term objectives. We aim to strengthen our capabilities, enhance our technology platforms, and expand our reach to better serve our clients. These investments are crucial for sustaining our competitive edge and delivering value over the long term.\n\nWhen it comes to share buybacks, they are an important tool for returning capital to shareholders when we believe our stock is undervalued relative to its intrinsic value. However, we approach buybacks with caution, particularly in volatile markets. It's essential to maintain flexibility and ensure that we have sufficient capital reserves to support our operations and address any potential challenges that may arise.\n\nUltimately, our capital strategy is about balancing immediate needs with future opportunities, ensuring that we remain a robust institution capable of weathering economic storms while continuing to grow and deliver for our shareholders. We will continue to monitor the macro environment closely and adjust our capital plans as necessary, always with an eye toward long-term stability and growth.",

      "question": "Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US treasuries if those reforms are implemented? And just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some of the recent volatility?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. So, SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which has deep flaws in them, to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks. It's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change.\n\nThe reason to change some of these things is so banks -- the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't -- if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea, but every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So, they should make these changes.\n\nThe reason why is when you have very -- lot of volatile markets and very widespread and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks themselves. And anyway -- and we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate the markets, help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no -- basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning, and thank you for the question. The proposed changes to the SLR are indeed an important topic given the current rate environment and geopolitical landscape. If relief were provided under the SLR, it would certainly give us more flexibility in terms of managing our balance sheet and potentially increase our capacity to purchase U.S. Treasuries. However, it's crucial to recognize that such decisions are not made in isolation.\n\nWhen we consider purchasing Treasuries or any other instruments, we take a holistic approach to managing rate risk across the firm. This involves looking at the entire curve, understanding our duration exposure, and ensuring that we're well-positioned for various interest rate scenarios. The recent volatility in the 10-year and other parts of the yield curve does prompt us to be cautious and diligent in our risk management practices.\n\nWe are always looking to balance our interest rate exposure with our liquidity needs and capital requirements. The geopolitical concerns and global demand dynamics for Treasuries are factors we weigh carefully. We're committed to being prudent in our approach, ensuring that we're protecting the firm while continuing to serve our clients effectively.\n\nUltimately, the SLR changes, if implemented, would be a positive step, allowing us more capacity to support the market and our clients. However, we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our strategies as needed to maintain a fortress balance sheet and navigate through any uncertainties in the market.",

      "question": "Very good. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads, that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system. And there should be -- and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, I think it's essential to approach these changes with a certain level of pragmatism and understanding that regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving. With the new administration and the personnel changes, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other nominees, there is always the potential for shifts in regulatory focus and priorities. However, it's important to remember that regulatory reform is a complex and lengthy process, and expectations should be managed accordingly.\n\nOur goal remains to work collaboratively with regulators to ensure that any adjustments to the regulatory framework are balanced, keeping in mind the safety and soundness of the financial system while also promoting economic growth and ensuring that banks can continue to serve their customers effectively. We hope that the new administration recognizes the importance of recalibrating certain aspects of regulation, like the SLR and G-SIB buffers, to better align with the current economic environment and the realities of today's financial landscape.\n\nUltimately, what matters most is maintaining a robust and resilient banking system that can withstand various economic scenarios while continuing to support clients through thick and thin. We remain committed to engaging constructively with regulators and policymakers to achieve that outcome.",

      "analyst": "Ebrahim Poonawala",
      "question": "Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you will have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates? Are the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs, is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all of that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him in the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with -- around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle, they're not going to be -- trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. When we talk about macro uncertainty, it's crucial to understand that businesses thrive on stability and predictability. The uncertainties surrounding trade tensions, regulatory changes, and geopolitical factors can have a dampening effect on business confidence and investment decisions. What corporate CEOs and our clients are really looking for is a clear, consistent policy framework that allows them to plan effectively.\n\nThe 90-day pause on tariffs, while a positive step, is more of a temporary relief than a long-term solution. Businesses are looking for comprehensive solutions that provide a level of certainty over a longer horizon. They need clarity on trade policies and assurance that there won't be abrupt or unexpected changes in the regulatory or fiscal environment.\n\nIn conversations with clients, what's often highlighted is the need for a coherent strategy from the administration that not only addresses immediate concerns like tariffs but also outlines a sustainable path forward for economic growth. This includes addressing infrastructure needs, fostering innovation, and ensuring a level playing field in international trade.\n\nUltimately, the key to restoring confidence lies in a combination of policy clarity, effective communication from policymakers, and a demonstrated commitment to supporting economic growth. Until businesses feel they have a stable environment in which to operate, we may continue to see some caution or conservatism in their forward guidance and investment plans.",

      "analyst": "Ebrahim Poonawala",
      "question": "Got it. And I guess, as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of week. Just your comfort level in terms of the functioning of the treasury market? Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Any color would be great.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you, I don't think that's going to go away and that relates to that. Obviously, the US dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed -- we've been consistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently it happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened, that will happen and then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we don't know if and when that's going to happen and we'll see.\n\nBut the notion that the 10-year treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, we have huge global deficits back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter, tariffs, at least our economists think, will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So, we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",
      "generated_answer": "The recent movement in the 10-year treasury yield is indeed noteworthy, and it highlights the volatility and uncertainty present in the market. The treasury market is a critical component of the global financial system, so its stability and orderly functioning are paramount. As for the Fed's potential actions, they have a range of tools at their disposal to address market disruptions, including pausing QT or even engaging in treasury purchases if necessary to ensure liquidity and stability.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Fed typically evaluates a myriad of factors before making such decisions, including economic data, inflation trends, and broader financial conditions. The recent yield movements may prompt discussions within the Fed about the appropriate monetary policy response, but any action would be carefully considered within the context of their dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nIn terms of our comfort level, we always prepare for a range of scenarios, given our strong capital and liquidity positions. We're equipped to navigate these fluctuations and continue serving our clients effectively. It's crucial to remain vigilant, adaptable, and prepared to respond to changes in the macroeconomic environment.",

And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive -- as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "I'll just also say that it may not be deposits, it may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen, which is different, is not the risk-off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.",
      "generated_answer": "Yes, we did observe a notable increase in deposits during March and April as a result of heightened market volatility. This is a typical reaction in such environments, where corporates and investors tend to move to cash as a safe haven. The influx was driven by multiple factors, including revolver drawdowns, government stimulus checks being deposited, and a general flight to quality as businesses and individuals sought the security of a strong financial institution like JPMorgan Chase. Additionally, the measures taken by the government and the Federal Reserve, such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and other fiscal and monetary initiatives, contributed to the increase in deposit balances. While we expect some of these deposits to be transient as markets stabilize and economic activity resumes, the current trend reflects the trust and reliability clients place in us during uncertain times.",

And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Again, almost impossible to answer. We look at all the cycles. We prepare for a full range of outcomes. So, not -- I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold, but I do -- I pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months. So, maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that.\n\nBut it's -- the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down. It looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know. But we are -- I've been quite cautious and you can see it in our capital, liquidity, our position, our balance sheet, and so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.",
      "generated_answer": "Good morning. Look, every cycle is unique in its own way, but there are definitely elements from past cycles that we can draw upon to inform how this one might progress. One of the key aspects of the current environment is the rapid pace of change and the number of moving parts, whether that's geopolitical tensions, shifts in monetary policy, or technological disruptions. \n\nWhat I would say is that this cycle is being shaped by a unique set of circumstances, particularly the lingering effects of the pandemic, the massive fiscal and monetary interventions we've seen globally, and the evolving landscape of global trade and supply chains. History tells us that cycles driven by such diverse and unprecedented factors can lead to different outcomes.\n\nThe critical thing to remember is that we're prepared for a range of scenarios. While we can't predict the future with certainty, we can ensure that we're ready to navigate whatever comes our way. We focus on being disciplined, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and staying agile so that we can adapt quickly as conditions change.\n\nIn terms of comparisons to past cycles, I would say this one has elements of both the post-2008 recovery, with its reliance on central bank actions, and the late 1990s tech boom, given the rapid pace of technological change we're seeing now. But again, every cycle is different, and our focus is on making sure JPMorgan is well-positioned to serve our clients and communities through thick and thin.",

And can you put -- you or Jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid as much as red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you'd pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation?\n\nBut before that, the negative which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman letter about the trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars \"get over it\" to this week say \"do something.\" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened? And do you really think next earnings call will be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",

And my quote was about to \"get over it,\" I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it.\n\nYou may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade. So -- and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of -- obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about \"get over it.\" I did not change my view about it.\n\nI would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too. Maybe the extent they want to do it, they said they're having conversations with 70 or 80 different people. And so, I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system.\n\nAnd I don't -- I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see, okay? There will be thousands -- hundreds of people maybe, but it's not going to be [passed on] (ph), but it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages if it's done right.\n\nI specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing that right now.",
      "generated_answer": "Sure, let's tackle these two important topics. Starting with the regulatory side, as I've mentioned before, there's a deep recognition of flaws in the current regulatory regime. We absolutely want to maintain the safety and soundness of the system, but we can achieve that with less red tape and bureaucracy. If you think about potential savings, it's hard to pinpoint an exact number, but streamlining processes and cutting unnecessary regulations could lead to significant cost reductions. This would likely result in savings that can be shared between customers, the bank, and even the regulators. The key is to maintain robust risk management practices while eliminating inefficiencies that don't contribute to systemic safety.\n\nNow, on the topic of trade wars, my perspective has indeed evolved. Initially, I advocated for a \"get over it\" approach because, in the short term, businesses can often absorb shocks and adapt. However, as these trade tensions have persisted and escalated, I've recognized the need for decisive action. The uncertainty around tariffs and trade policies creates a challenging environment for businesses to plan effectively, and this can have broader implications for the economy. As to whether we'll be through most of the uncertainty by the next earnings call, it's difficult to say. Much depends on the actions taken by policymakers and whether we see constructive negotiations that lead to resolution rather than escalation. It's crucial for all parties involved to work towards solutions that foster stability and growth.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "If you do all -- if you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%. And the reason for that isn't -- it's not just capital. It is also LCR. It is also G-SIFIs.\n\nAnd the question you should ask, because you are very smart, Mike, is could you -- have the same -- and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to the First Republic of Silicon Valley, and you can accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nYou can read our -- I think our [MPRs] (ph) are public and stuff like that. And so, they should do that, just make a better system. We have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. And if you don't -- I'd say, when you look at these rules and regulations, see Europe. If that's where we want to go, let's just go there.",
      "generated_answer": "Absolutely. The point I was making is that if the capital requirements, specifically the CET1 ratio, were reduced even slightly, it would significantly enhance our capacity to extend credit. Currently, we are sitting on a substantial amount of excess capital, and while we remain committed to maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet, there is potential for more proactive capital deployment. By optimizing our capital structure, we could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in additional lending capacity, which would not only support our growth but also contribute positively to the broader economy by facilitating more credit availability to businesses and consumers.

How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.",

      "question": "Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree flawed regulatory system could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are you -- are the systems better? Are they better able to handle it as your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy -- I agree with Jeremy. I'd add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid/ask spreads that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes, so you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps and a whole bunch of different things, treasuries, that's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you're seeing in DCM today, when you don't have bond deals, when you have less trading, when you have -- so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients. So, we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads go up or down and pretty bad.\n\nBut the plumbing of the system, I would say, the plumbing worked well during COVID, too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and it wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had. So -- but you're always worried about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, Glenn, I think it's a combination of factors that have contributed to our ability to manage through this volatility effectively. First, I would say that the regulatory framework, while not perfect, has certainly improved the resilience of the financial system. The capital and liquidity requirements imposed post-2008 have ensured that banks are well-capitalized and capable of withstanding significant stress. \n\nOn top of that, our risk management systems have evolved significantly. We've invested heavily in technology and data analytics, which have enhanced our ability to monitor and manage risk dynamically. The diversity of our platform also plays a crucial role. It allows us to spread risk across various asset classes, geographies, and client types, which helps us absorb shocks more effectively.\n\nHowever, I would caution that not all volatility is beneficial. There are still scenarios that could present significant challenges, especially if they were to impact liquidity or counterparty risk in a way that's systemic. The market plumbing has held up so far, but we must remain vigilant. We're constantly evaluating and refining our risk management strategies to ensure we're prepared for whatever comes our way.\n\nUltimately, while we've navigated recent volatility well, we remain mindful of the complexities and potential risks in the market. It’s about being proactive, staying agile, and always being ready to learn and adapt.",

      "question": "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess, how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts? If you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn, I think you do have -- in the $95 billion guidance, you do have good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you -- does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments or do you think that's just completely short sighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "As you said management thing, because I think it's very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses, and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off. And -- but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can imagine -- if you go to -- if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail.\n\nAnd so, there is -- we're making a -- I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID, the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the -- and Mike Mayo mentioned the thing about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit.\n\nI mean, we -- I pointed out resolution recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long, okay? It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long, okay? We report 1 trillion -- I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the -- all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we -- that hopefully we can get rid of and reduce the cost of the system and -- but it's not new branches. So, the folks here are working on, we call, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that. So -- and we're having fun doing it. It's like -- to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so -- and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, first of all, thank you for the question. When it comes to costs and investments, we have always taken a long-term view. Our strategy is to invest through cycles, and we believe that this approach positions us well for the future. The investments we're making in bankers, branches, technology, and marketing are crucial for driving growth and maintaining our competitive edge.\n\nWe don't make these decisions lightly, and we are constantly evaluating the return on investment for each of these areas. If we see a significant downturn, we would, of course, reassess our priorities, but that doesn't mean we stop investing. It might mean we reprioritize or adjust the pace of some initiatives, but the fundamental strategy remains intact.\n\nIt's important to remember that these investments are not just about immediate returns. They're about building capabilities and market position that will serve us well over the long term. So while we remain vigilant and ready to adapt to changing conditions, pulling back on critical investments without a compelling reason would be short-sighted. We aim to balance prudence with the need to position ourselves for future success.",

      "question": "Jamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to?\n\nAnd secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Chris, just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture, so nothing has happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that.\n\nAnd then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing.\n\nAnd how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for America? And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.",
      "generated_answer": "Sure, let me address both parts of your question. \n\nFirstly, on financial deregulation, I would say there's always optimism when there's talk about reducing some of the regulatory burdens that have been placed on banks over the years. But I would caution against expecting any dramatic changes overnight. The regulatory landscape is complex, and changes typically take time to implement. That said, if there are areas where rules can be recalibrated to better reflect the current environment, support economic growth, and maintain safety and soundness, that would be beneficial. For example, looking at recalibrating things like the G-SIFI surcharge or how operational risk capital is calculated could make a lot of sense. But again, we have to wait and see how this evolves.\n\nAs for capital, our priority has always been to use it to support our customers and grow our business. Right now, we continue to be well-capitalized, and we're generating strong capital through our earnings. In terms of specific uses, we always prioritize organic growth opportunities. We want to continue investing in our businesses to serve our clients better and to drive long-term shareholder value. \n\nIn terms of timing, a lot depends on external factors like the macroeconomic environment and the regulatory landscape. If the economy continues to recover and regulatory frameworks are adjusted in a way that provides more flexibility, we could look at things like returning more capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. But for now, we're focused on maintaining a strong capital position to ensure we can weather any storms and support our stakeholders effectively.",

It's a scale business, and there's room for us to expand both organically and inorganically.\n\nIn Payments, there's a lot of activity and competition, particularly from fintechs.

Stablecoins are an important development in the financial industry, and they have the potential to significantly impact how we think about digital transactions and cross-border payments. At JPMorgan, we view stablecoins as a tool that can enhance the efficiency of the global payment system, provided they are properly regulated to ensure stability and security.\n\nWe're actively exploring how these digital assets can be integrated into our operations. Our own JPM Coin is a prime example of how we're leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate instantaneous payments and settlements for our institutional clients. It's designed to address the needs of our corporate clients by offering a secure, digital way to transfer value.\n\nAs for the JPMD deposit token, it fits into our broader strategy by providing a digital representation of a deposit account. This could potentially streamline operations and offer clients more flexibility in managing their finances. We're also paying close attention to regulatory developments to ensure any steps we take align with compliance standards and enhance our service offerings.\n\nIn the broader landscape, while stablecoins present opportunities, they also bring challenges, particularly around regulatory oversight and the need for a robust framework to prevent misuse.

And we want real clarity about that.\n\nAnd if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third-party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility in their part.

      "question": "This almost sounds like a fintech and AI call. But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release, give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the U.S., what's the state of play there? When we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing, should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out 6, 9, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that we all look at?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "You can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We've built, I think 500 bank of the innovation economy, which is kind of new to us. I think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business, regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next 6 to 9 months.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, let's discuss the middle market businesses. The middle market sector in the U.S. is generally in good shape, but like any part of the economy, it's not immune to various macroeconomic pressures. When we look at interest rates, they're obviously an important factor. Higher rates can increase borrowing costs, which might put some pressure on businesses, especially those that are highly leveraged. However, many middle market companies have been able to lock in lower rates over the past few years, which provides some cushion.\n\nWhen it comes to tariffs and trade tensions, these can certainly impact certain industries more than others, particularly those reliant on global supply chains or export-heavy businesses. We've seen some businesses adjust by diversifying their supply chains or rethinking their sourcing strategies. Consumer spending is another critical factor. While there have been some signs of slowing, it's important to note that consumer spending is still relatively strong, supported by low unemployment and wage growth. This underpins a lot of activity in the middle market space.\n\nAs for credit quality, we're obviously keeping a close eye on it. But right now, the credit environment remains healthy. Middle market companies have generally been prudent in managing their balance sheets, and banks, including us, have been cautious and disciplined in our underwriting.\n\nOverall, while there are certainly clouds on the horizon, such as geopolitical tensions or potential slowdowns in consumer spending, we're not overly concerned about a dramatic deterioration in credit quality in the near term. Of course, we remain vigilant and are prepared to adjust our strategies as necessary to navigate any challenges that arise.",

      "question": "Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography?\n\nAnd Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And to answer your other question, Mike. So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second.\n\nSo G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and stuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book.\n\nAnd when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",
      "generated_answer": "**Jeremy:** Certainly. Commercial loan growth was notably stronger in the second quarter due to a combination of factors. There was increased demand across various sectors as businesses continued to recover from the pandemic and sought financing for expansion and operational needs. Geographically, we saw particular strength in regions where economic activity rebounded more robustly, such as certain parts of the U.S. and Asia. Additionally, sectors like technology and healthcare drove a significant portion of this growth as companies in these areas looked to capitalize on new opportunities and invest in innovation.\n\n**Jamie:** Regarding what regulators could do to encourage more lending, it's essential to focus on creating an environment that supports sustainable growth while ensuring financial stability. Regulators could consider recalibrating certain capital requirements and liquidity rules to provide banks with more flexibility without compromising safety and soundness. For instance, adjustments to the G-SIFI surcharge or operational risk capital requirements could free up capital that banks could then deploy into productive lending. Additionally, fostering a balanced regulatory framework that supports innovation and competition could encourage banks to extend credit to underserved segments and regions, aligning with broader economic goals. It's about finding the right balance to ensure that banks can lend effectively while maintaining robust risk management practices.",

      "question": "You didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, and I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things can reduce the actual cost of making loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we've just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.",
      "generated_answer": "When we talk about costs, it's important to remember that the cost to make a loan isn't just about the interest rate environment or the macroeconomic factors. It's also about efficiency, technology, and the processes we have in place. At JPMorgan, we're constantly looking at ways to streamline our operations and make things more efficient. This includes leveraging technology to automate processes and reduce manual tasks, which can help lower the overall cost structure.\n\nIn terms of lending, we are always evaluating how we can make the process more seamless for both the client and us. This includes digital platforms that can speed up the lending process, reduce paperwork, and improve the customer experience. It's about making sure that we're not just being cost-effective but also enhancing the service we provide to our clients.\n\nWe also consider the regulatory environment, which can add complexity and cost to the lending process. So, streamlining isn't just about cutting costs; it's about ensuring compliance and managing risk effectively while delivering value to our clients.\n\nSo yes, there's always potential for streamlining, but it's about doing it in a way that balances efficiency with the quality of service and risk management.",

And I'm not saying it's not going to grow some more, but I just -- I would have a slight reluctance depending on who it was. But you might -- your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us, natural fit being product and people and culture.",
      "generated_answer": "When I refer to \"peak private credit,\" I'm talking about the rapid growth and expansion of the private credit markets that we've seen over the past few years. This sector has been fueled by a search for yield in a low-interest-rate environment and an increase in demand for direct lending and less traditional financing methods outside of the banking sector. However, with any rapidly expanding market, there are inherent risks, including less transparency, potential liquidity issues, and a lack of rigorous regulatory oversight compared to traditional banks. \n\nWe've seen a significant amount of capital flowing into private credit, with some market participants possibly underestimating the risks associated with illiquid assets and the potential for stress during economic downturns. While private credit can provide flexibility and speed in lending, it's also important for investors to be aware of the potential for market corrections or disruptions, particularly if economic conditions change or if there's a shift in interest rates.\n\nTherefore, when I talk about \"peak private credit,\" I'm suggesting that we may be nearing a point where the growth in this sector could face headwinds, especially if we encounter more challenging economic conditions or if regulatory scrutiny increases. It's crucial for market participants to remain cautious and ensure they're prepared for any potential volatility.",

And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "In a competitive world, it is irrational to thing that -- and when it applies to all the competitors that everyone is just going to make a lot more money to keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.\n\nAnd Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. Now they should do a low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff, if you didn't do, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns. That we just -- we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches, that does our private bank or things like that.",
      "generated_answer": "Thank you for the question. We've always been clear that our goal is to serve our clients effectively while maintaining strong risk management and capital discipline. If we do indeed see a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both capital and liquidity constraints, it certainly could have positive implications for our ROTCE. A more efficient regulatory environment could allow us to optimize our balance sheet more effectively, potentially improving returns.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that any changes in regulatory requirements are intended to ensure the stability and safety of the financial system. Our primary focus will always be on maintaining the trust of our clients and the integrity of our operations. If we can achieve efficiencies through regulatory simplification, we would evaluate how best to leverage those efficiencies, whether that's improving pricing for clients, reinvesting in our business, or enhancing shareholder returns.\n\nIn essence, while a streamlined regulatory framework might provide opportunities for enhanced returns, our commitment remains to serve our clients well and manage our capital prudently. The balance between optimizing returns and serving clients is a dynamic one, and we'll continue to assess it as regulatory developments unfold.",

And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement.\n\nAnd the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly, we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it -- does activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels, or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Jeremy, you might want to -- I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. And so that lesson we've learned over and over, it may stay wide open for 1.5 years. Something may happen geopolitically that all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yes, you're going to have really active markets.\n\nI do think that extending the tax bill for business to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done.\n\nI also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial Liberation Day, now there's more talk as more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed, that reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1.",
      "generated_answer": "Yes, that's a great question. So what we're seeing is that the pickup in activity levels late in the quarter was indeed influenced by several factors that provided more certainty to our clients. The concerns around extreme outcomes from tariff policies and the uncertainty around the tax bill were definitely weighing on sentiment earlier in the quarter. As we moved past some of those hurdles, we saw clients becoming more comfortable with the environment, which translated into increased activity.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't say all concerns have been fully eliminated. There's always a level of caution in the market, and clients are still navigating a complex macroeconomic environment. But the removal of some of the more immediate uncertainties has certainly helped improve sentiment and activity levels. As we look into the second half of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic. We believe that as long as there is no significant deterioration in the economic environment or unexpected geopolitical events, activity levels should continue to be healthy. Our teams are fully engaged with clients to help them navigate these complexities and capture opportunities as they arise.",

      "question": "Okay. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators looked at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks, or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheet into lower-risk assets. Do you see that -- is it really just a supply issue? Or how do you think about the demand/supply dynamic? And is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower-margin areas? Just your thoughts.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And I'm like a broken record. It's not SLR, it's LCR, it's G-SIFI, it's CCAR, it's Basel IV, the gold-plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, et cetera. And even how you measure liquidity, which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery. They should look at all of that. If they really want to fix the system.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. When discussing the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and the regulatory adjustments around it, it's important to recognize the broader picture of balance sheet management and opportunities for growth. The regulators' move to adjust the SLR was indeed a strategic decision to encourage banks to leverage their balance sheets more effectively, particularly in relation to lower-risk assets.\n\nFrom our perspective, the SLR reduction does provide a bit more breathing room to manage our balance sheet dynamically. It allows us to consider growing in areas that are perhaps lower-margin but align with our overarching strategy to serve clients and maintain a robust risk profile. This isn't just about expanding for the sake of growth; it’s about being thoughtful and strategic in how we deploy capital.\n\nThe demand and supply dynamics come into play significantly here. While the regulatory environment has provided us with the tools to expand, the actual growth also depends heavily on market demand. If there's a demand for certain types of loans or securities, and if we see value in those opportunities, we’re in a better position to capitalize on them without being overly constrained by regulatory ratios.\n\nIn terms of opportunities, it's really about where we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return. While the SLR adjustment might create opportunities in lower-margin areas, it’s critical that any growth aligns with our long-term strategic goals and risk management framework. We are focused on making sure that we are not just chasing volume, but also ensuring that the growth is sustainable and beneficial for all our stakeholders.\n\nSo, in summary, while the SLR adjustment opens up some avenues, our approach remains disciplined and focused on strategic growth, balanced with sound risk management practices.",

The value to shareholders is that we cannot just earn 17% ROTCE is that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value.

And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing.\n\nIf you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers internationally. And when we look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe is it's been great. Innovation economy has been great. We're gaining shares in a lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the international -- payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that is the best way to use it.\n\nYou have all of our major bank competitors are back, rolling and expanding. Then you have the fintech folks, who are quite capable and quite smart, who you don't want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion is that somehow we're not going to deal with tough competitors, right, which protects JPMorgan Chase, if we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on realizing -- you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day.\n\nAnd so we're quite cautious to just declare victory, like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, because I had Jeremy do this number one point, if you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America -- for 40 years maybe.",
      "generated_answer": "When we set our ROTCE target at 17%, we were looking at a through-the-cycle number that reflects our ability to generate sustainable returns over the long term. The 20% ROTCE this quarter is indeed strong, but it's important to understand the context and the factors contributing to this performance.\n\nFirst, the business has certainly evolved, and we've made significant investments in technology, expansion, and talent, which have enhanced our capabilities and efficiencies. These investments are starting to bear fruit, contributing to the solid returns we're seeing.\n\nHowever, there are also favorable tailwinds currently at play. For instance, the macroeconomic environment, including interest rates and credit conditions, has been supportive. We've acknowledged that we're in a robust credit environment, with charge-offs at historically low levels, which are not likely to persist indefinitely. Additionally, market conditions have been strong, which has benefited our trading and investment banking businesses.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while our CET1 ratio guidance has shifted, reflecting regulatory and market conditions, our focus remains on maintaining a strong capital position to support growth and stability.\n\nSo, while we are pleased with the current performance, we are cautious about adjusting our long-term targets until we have a clearer view of how sustainable these conditions are. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital management and investment, ensuring we are well-positioned for both current opportunities and future challenges.",

      "question": "If I could get an answer to this from both you, Jeremy, and Jamie, the question really is how much of a risk is the lending to the NDFIs? Just -- I mean, because you guys are always outfront highlighting what could happen, whether it's cyber or as you point, labor market or inflation. And I feel like you haven't really highlighted this as a potential risk area. Maybe that's because you don't perceive it as such, but you have Tricolor, you have First Brands. One area of your biggest growth, I think, has been NDFIs over the last year.\n\nSo I'm just trying to put this in some sort of context that as it relates to Tricolor, who bears the losses? Does end investors in the funds? Is it -- do you put skin in the game and have your own investments? Are you an underwriter? Where are you exposed? So I guess I'm asking JPMorgan specifically but then Jamie more generally for the industry. Is this something that's flashing yellow that you are spending more time on? How should we think about that?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. Mike, I would just add that it's a very large category of nonbank financial institutions and probably a number like half of it, we would consider very traditional, not like different. There is a component, which is different today than it was years ago, and there's a component which isn't that different. But if you look at like COs, CLOs and lending to leveraged entities that are underwritten with leveraged loans, so there's kind of a little bit of double leverage in there.\n\nI would say that, yes, there will be additional risk in that category that we will see when we have a downturn. I expect to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be because we don't know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did. Jeremy said these are very smart players. They know what they're doing. They've been around a long time but they're not all very smart. And we don't even know the standards that other banks underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that some of those standards may not be as good as you think. Hopefully, we are very good, though we make our mistakes, too, obviously.\n\nSo yes, I think you'd be a little bit worse. We've had a benign credit environment for so long that I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate a little bit more than people think when, in fact, there's a downturn. And hopefully, it will be a fairly normal credit cycle. What always happens is something is worse than a normal credit cycle than a normal downturn. So we'll see. But we think we're quite careful. And obviously, we scour the world looking for things that we should be worried about.\n\nBut I do remind people, we've had a bull market for a long time. Asset prices are high, a lot of credit stuff that you would see out there, you will only see when there's a downturn.",
      "generated_answer": "Sure, let me take a stab at this. First, I'll address JPMorgan specifically, and then I'll give a broader industry perspective.\n\nAt JPMorgan, when it comes to lending to non-deposit financial institutions (NDFIs), we're quite strategic and disciplined in our approach. We have a well-established risk management framework that ensures we understand the credit profile and risk exposure associated with these entities. In the case of specific investments like Tricolor or First Brands, the risk is primarily borne by the end investors in the funds. We might have some skin in the game, but we are very careful about the exposure we take on. Our role is often as an underwriter or facilitator, and we are very selective about the partners we work with.\n\nNow, in terms of the broader industry perspective, non-deposit financial institutions have become a more significant part of the financial landscape, and they do bring with them certain risks. However, these risks are generally well-managed. Most NDFIs have strong capital bases and are subject to regulatory oversight, which provides a level of safety.\n\nWe do keep a close eye on the sector, and while I wouldn't say it's flashing yellow, it's certainly an area we monitor closely. We're always alert to changes in the economic environment that could affect these institutions, and we're prepared to adjust our exposure accordingly. It's important to have the right balance, and we're confident in our ability to manage this part of our business prudently.\n\nJeremy might want to add something specific about how we're approaching this within the context of our overall risk management strategy, but that's the general overview from my side.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. I mean, Michael, you should assume that whenever something happens, we scour all process, all procedures, all underwriting, all everything. And we think we're okay in other stuff. But I -- my antenna goes up when things like that happen. And I probably shouldn't say this but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. And so we should -- everyone should be forewarn on this one. And first brands, I put in the same category. And there are a couple of other ones out that I've seen that I put in similar categories. So -- but we always look at these things, and we're not -- I'm nipping in. We make mistakes, too. So we'll see. There clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things. But that doesn't mean we can't improve our procedures.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly. At JPMorgan, we are always committed to maintaining the highest standards in our processes and due diligence. When something like the Tricolor situation arises, it prompts us to take a step back and review our procedures critically. We continuously examine and, where necessary, refine our processes to ensure they are as robust as possible. This includes looking at our risk management frameworks, our due diligence processes, and how we vet partnerships and collaborations. While Tricolor might be a small part of our larger operations, it's essential to learn from every situation to better serve our clients and stakeholders and to maintain the integrity and trust that we strive to uphold in all our dealings.",

      "question": "Jeremy, obviously, you guys are in the residential mortgage lending market, big players granted home lending. When you look at the revenue relative to banking and wealth management, obviously, it's not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be -- when they come out with comments, they follow up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessent has pointed out about a couple of months ago that he thinks there's a housing emergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is, what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the corresponding treasury yield, assuming the treasury yields don't go down. But what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower mortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity, of course, would pick up with that.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "So I'll take that one. First, on the supply side. I mean it's -- we know what it is. It's permitting, it's rules, it's local rules. It's how long it takes to get permits and build not my backyard, you can't build 2 stories in certain places. That's the supply side. The demand side -- and remember, don't always push homeownership. I was -- we made a huge mistake in the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I've been talking about it for years that they should focus on reducing requirements require and we think you reduce the cost of mortgages 30 to 40 basis points overall. without creating any additional risk. There is just excessive stuff put in place after the great financial crisis, which obviously demanded a response but it's excessive. Anyone to take it out a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all these things. So that to me is the most obvious one.\n\nAnd obviously, government policy, if the government wants to do more FHA, they can do that. But that's up to them about where they want to cheap in mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that. But if they did anything like that, I would say, always do it really thoughtfully.",
      "generated_answer": "Certainly, that's an important topic, especially given the current housing market dynamics. The spread between mortgage rates and treasury yields is influenced by several factors, including credit risk, servicing costs, regulatory requirements, and the overall demand for mortgage-backed securities. \n\nTo address the housing emergency and potentially lower that spread, there are several actions the administration could consider:\n\n1. **Regulatory Adjustments**: One of the key components affecting mortgage rates is the regulatory framework surrounding mortgage lending. Simplifying or adjusting some of the more stringent requirements, particularly those that add to servicing and origination costs, could help reduce the spread. For instance, revisiting elements of the Qualified Mortgage (QM) rule or reducing the capital requirements for certain types of mortgage-backed securities could provide some relief.\n\n2. **Support for Securitization**: Encouraging a more robust secondary market for mortgages through securitization can help. By making the securitization process more efficient and less costly, you can provide lenders with more flexibility to offer competitive rates. This could involve revisiting GSE reform to ensure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are well-positioned to support the market.\n\n3. **Direct Support and Subsidies**: Providing targeted subsidies or support for certain borrowers might also help. This could include measures to assist first-time homebuyers or lower-income families, which could be implemented through direct subsidies or tax incentives.\n\n4. **Increased Liquidity**: Ensuring that liquidity remains ample in the mortgage market is crucial. The Fed could play a role here by purchasing mortgage-backed securities if needed to ensure that spreads don't widen unnecessarily due to liquidity constraints.\n\n5. **Addressing Supply Constraints**: On the supply side, encouraging new home builds and renovations through zoning reforms or incentives for builders could help alleviate some of the pressure on home prices, indirectly affecting the demand and rates for mortgages.\n\nUltimately, any policy change needs to be carefully crafted to balance the desire for lower rates with the need to manage risk appropriately. It's a complex equation, but with thoughtful adjustments, there is certainly room to make homeownership more accessible and affordable.",

Can you guys give us any color of what you're actually seeing on the ground. We're, what, 9 months or so into this new administration with the new regulators? And then also any color on when you think Basel III end game may come out and what you're hearing in terms of how it will compare to what the original proposal was in July of '23.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes. And I just add the Dana number, they are doing that. They're looking at it holistically, that's great. But Dana number is right. I've said for years, G-SIB, CCAR, operational risk capital, double counting of the trading book, I mean it's just wrong. And some of these numbers are so inaccurate that they published that they should publish them with the disclosure saying, we know these are highly inaccurate like the CCAR test. We know that this is not remotely related to reality or stuff like that. So it's almost a dishonest disclosure of these things, like do the actual number.\n\nThe second thing they really should do, which I think they're doing is what is the intended effect and what's the unintended effect. So we talk about -- we've gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 public companies. We've gone from pushing mortgages out of the banking system to a huge buildup in parts of the nonbank institutions and a huge amount of arbitrage taking place. I was a regulator, I'd be looking at all that and say, my God, is that what I wanted. And the biggest frustration is they couldn't fixed all these things, reduce liquidity, reduce capital, all these things and made the system safer.\n\nSo we had a Silicon Valley Bank blow up because they're so focused on governance, they forgot to focus on interest rate exposure. And they are making changes that, like what is actually real risk banks are bearing as opposed to walk signaling on what a bank should be doing all the time. So hopefully, they'll do it. I think they're devoted to doing it. Like look at their words and their speeches, I'm talking about the OCC, the Fed, the FDIC. So I think it's very good. Let's get it done quickly.",
      "generated_answer": "Well, first, let me just say, we've seen a shift in tone with the new administration, which is pretty typical when there's a change in leadership. We're seeing a focus on some different priorities, particularly around climate, consumer protection, and financial inclusion. That's not entirely surprising given the signals we got during the election campaign and the early days of the new administration.\n\nIn terms of the regulatory landscape, we're definitely expecting a more rigorous approach. We're seeing increased focus on stress testing, capital requirements, and risk management, which are all areas that have been emphasized by the new regulators. It's important to remember that these changes often take time to fully materialize as new leadership settles in and begins to implement their priorities.\n\nRegarding Basel III, it's hard to predict exactly when we'll see the endgame, but we're expecting more details to surface over the coming months. The regulators have been working through the complexities of these rules, and we anticipate they will take a thoughtful approach to balance financial stability with the need for banks to continue supporting economic growth. The original proposal from July 2023 had some challenging elements, and we're hopeful that the final version will consider the feedback from the industry to ensure it doesn't stifle our ability to lend and support our clients effectively.\n\nUltimately, we're prepared to adapt to whatever comes our way. We've always prided ourselves on being a well-capitalized, well-managed institution, and we'll continue to work closely with regulators to ensure we're aligned with their expectations while serving the best interests of our clients.",

      "question": "My first one is for you, Jeremy. Under the category no good deed goes unpunished. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the expense outlook for '26. You mentioned that $100 billion could be a little low and that you're in the middle of the planning cycle. That would imply 4% growth year-over-year. Is that the sort of new normal labor rate inflation that we should assume at this point?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "And Erika, just add to that, medical, we spent $3 billion or so in medical. That's going to be up 10% next year. And so when you look at some of these things, and we know that already and maybe we think it actually might be up another 10% in 2027 for a whole bunch of different reasons. And that's one thing. The other thing about comp, I just want to point it out, there's normal inflation and pay-for-performance, all that. There's a lot of pressure on -- from other people who are paying people quite well, hedge funds, law firms, private equity, nonbank financial institutions, and we are going to pay our people competitively. That is sine qua non if you want to have a great company for the next 20 years.\n\nAnd so there's some of that, too. I'm not sure that it's going to change very much when you look at it but I would put in the back of your mind, too. It's probably good for you all to hear me say that.

When it comes to expenses, particularly looking ahead to 2026, we're always trying to balance investing in our future with maintaining operational efficiency.

A 4% growth rate year-over-year is certainly reflective of the environment we're operating in, especially considering factors like labor market inflation and the investments we're making in technology and other strategic areas. However, we remain committed to being disciplined with our spending and ensuring that every dollar we invest is aimed at driving long-term shareholder value.

      "question": "I'll make sure to send this transcript to my boss. But the second question is actually for you, Jamie. You have always had a differentiated way of thinking about risk and a 2-part question for you. Number one, I feel like we don't even know what the right questions are to ask when it comes to NDFI exposure and risk, which is such a broad category. And so a 2-part question here. Number one, what would be the questions you think investors should ask when assessing NDFI exposure as it relates to future credit risk? And second, should investors be concerned about the SSFA accounting for RWAs in certain structures where you could lower the RWAs to NDFI exposures from 100% to something much lower?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Which SSFA?\n\nIs that insurance related.\n\nMaybe we take a crack and tell you a little bit more about it. We feel fairly comfortable with our exposure in that. But I think what you should do is -- I think when we have a downturn, this is the important thing, there will be a credit cycle. And we shouldn't be surprised. The credit card losses go up, middle market loss go up, everything gets worse in a downturn in credit. I do suspect -- I can't prove this, and I don't know because we don't know everyone's underwriting standards. Every now and we see what someone else is doing, we're surprised that their standards are not particularly good, but that's always been true. I suspect when there's a downturn, you will see higher than normal downturn type of credit losses in certain categories. I just suspect that.\n\nAnd so the other thing, which you can do, which I'm going to ask Mike Grub to do for me because I asked periodically, look at the pricing of BDCs and their publicly traded private credit facilities and do the homework. There are disclosures around that, and we do it. And so maybe we take just a crack at one point, laying out the different carriers of MBFIs and ones that might be concerning and ones that aren't concerning.",
      "generated_answer": "As always, thank you for the insightful questions. When it comes to assessing NDFI (Non-Depository Financial Institutions) exposure and future credit risk, I think there are a few key areas that investors should focus on:\n\n1. **Concentration Risk**: It's crucial to understand the extent of a bank's exposure to NDFIs within its credit portfolio. What percentage of total loans are to NDFIs, and is there a significant concentration in any particular segment, like private credit or fintech lending? Concentration risk can amplify potential losses if the segment faces stress.\n\n2. **Credit Quality and Underwriting Standards**: Evaluate the credit quality of the NDFIs to which the bank is exposed. Are these institutions well-capitalized? What are their underwriting standards like? How do they manage risk, especially in volatile economic conditions? It's important to assess whether these NDFIs have a strong track record of managing credit risk effectively.\n\n3. **Liquidity and Funding Sources**: Understand the liquidity profiles and funding sources of the NDFIs. Do they rely heavily on short-term funding? How diversified are their funding sources? Liquidity risk is a significant concern, especially for NDFIs that might not have the same access to central bank facilities as traditional banks.\n\n4. **Regulatory Environment**: NDFIs often operate in a less regulated environment compared to traditional banks. Investors should consider the regulatory landscape and any potential changes that could impact the operations or risk profiles of these institutions.\n\nAs for the second part of your question regarding the SSFA (Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach) accounting for RWAs, it's a valid concern. The SSFA allows for a more granular approach in calculating risk weights for securitization exposures, which can sometimes lead to lower RWA requirements. While this can be beneficial in optimizing capital, it's essential to ensure that the underlying risks are still being accurately captured. Investors should question whether the reduction in RWAs truly reflects a decrease in risk or if it's more of an accounting maneuver. It's important to maintain a balance between capital efficiency and prudent risk management.\n\nOverall, while NDFIs present opportunities, they also come with unique risks. It's about understanding those risks thoroughly and ensuring that banks' exposures are aligned with their risk appetite and capital strength.",

We've seen strong interest and good additions with the refresh, which is encouraging.\n\nWhen it comes to the financial impact, especially regarding the awards amortization and the card fees line, it's important to note that these elements are typically spread over the life of the cardholder relationship. So, while you'll see some increase in expenses related to awards and benefits in the near term, the goal is to drive higher engagement and spend in the long term.
