2025Q1,April 11 2025,1,Operator,Thank you. Please standby. Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous. You may proceed.,16,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,2,Ken Usdin,"Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your -- some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.",72,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,3,Jeremy Barnum,"Sure, Ken. So, I mean, at a high level, I would say that, obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side.

I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there is what would appear to be a certain amount of front-loading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So, ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions.

In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment.

So, as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients is a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve, and also across the size of the clients, I think, smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage.

So, that's a little bit of our read of the situation right now, but certainly a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now. And so, we'll see how that plays out.",320,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,4,Ken Usdin,"Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day? And what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.",63,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,5,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah, that's a good question, Ken, and you're right. So, if you remember, last quarter, we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we're asset-sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively lower-than-modeled rates paid in consumer. So, when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets.",111,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,6,Jamie Dimon,In the curve basically.,4,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,7,Jeremy Barnum,Yeah. That's basically -- that's just mechanically...,7,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,8,Jamie Dimon,Guaranteed not to happen.,4,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,9,Jeremy Barnum,"As Ken said. So, that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So, yeah, your question is that given that why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook, but we do have some offsets. So, we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale.

The other thing is that you'll recall we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the card late fee rule. We've now removed that, so that's a little bit of an offset as well. So, that's kind of how you get to unchanged even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind.",166,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,10,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.,14,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,11,Erika Najarian,"Yes, good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence, but Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be -- the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players, given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of the ability of the banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward? And maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that banking -- the banking system should be a source of strength?",131,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,12,Jeremy Barnum,"I just -- before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment.",101,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,13,Jamie Dimon,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way. So, sentiment -- but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too.

And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the next month.

And then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you see that.

And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is.

I just also want to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion. And then, to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month -- three-quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stock will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",436,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,14,Erika Najarian,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience? And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you're going -- obviously, deterioration in outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?",124,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,15,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah, Erika, it's a good question, but the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the accident forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog-standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment.

Given that we knew at the time that there was some -- there were some big pending announcements and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information. And so, it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.

We use this weighted average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve, but obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth of any potential recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors it hits, idiosyncratic stuff and wholesale, there's a lot.

I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So, if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.",248,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,16,Erika Najarian,Thank you.,2,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,17,Operator,Thank you. Our next question...,5,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,18,Jeremy Barnum,"Thanks, Erika.",2,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,19,Operator,I apologize. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.,15,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,20,John McDonald,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year, or just too early to call?",62,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,21,Jeremy Barnum,"We should have not given you that forecast. We don't know what the number is going to be. I would say it's a short-term number, and based on what's happening today, there's a wide range of potential outcomes.",38,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,22,John McDonald,"Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah, that's what we're kind of thinking, and...",11,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,23,Jeremy Barnum,"But mechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way card charge-offs works. That means that it's pretty baked, pretty far out of time...",30,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,24,Jamie Dimon,"[At least] (ph) couple of quarters, yeah.",7,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,25,Jeremy Barnum,"So, sort of echoing Jamie's point, it just doesn't necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year. Even if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn't flow through the charge-offs until later.",41,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,26,John McDonald,"Okay, got it. And then, just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Just are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?",53,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,27,Jamie Dimon,"The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then, we have, depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that, but based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment and that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So -- but we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.",108,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,28,John McDonald,Okay. Thank you.,3,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,29,Jeremy Barnum,"Thanks, John.",2,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,30,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.,16,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,31,Matt O'Connor,Good morning. Just want to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines and travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.,47,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,32,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah, it's a good question. We're seeing that, too. So, let me talk about travel. I mean, we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them specifically in airline travel and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend.

And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be -- have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So, you see people behaving rationally and I have noted even you hear anecdotes and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising. We have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So, it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data.

The other thing that people are kind of interested in the space is like what's happening by income then, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower-income segment. And I think when we look at our card data and also our cash buffers and people's checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower-income segment.

But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower-income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin cash buffers are lower and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments, but actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower-income segment. So, no evidence of distress, I would say.",316,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,33,Matt O'Connor,"Okay. That's helpful color. And then, just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the home lending, they increased both Q2 and year-over-year. Is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios essentially [receding] (ph) from an accounting point of view, or is there something else going on there?",63,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,34,Jeremy Barnum,"Sorry, I actually didn't hear which fees...",7,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,35,Jamie Dimon,The delinquencies in the home lending.,6,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,36,Jeremy Barnum,"I didn't -- interesting. I haven't looked at that. We'll have to get back to you on that. Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised. So...",29,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,37,Jamie Dimon,"It could be the First Republic accounting, yes.",8,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,38,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes, anything is possible. We'll get back to you on that.",11,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,39,Matt O'Connor,Okay. Thank you.,3,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,40,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.,15,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,41,Steven Chubak,"Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US treasuries if those reforms are implemented? And just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some of the recent volatility?",99,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,42,Jamie Dimon,"Yeah. So, SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which has deep flaws in them, to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks. It's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change.

The reason to change some of these things is so banks -- the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't -- if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea, but every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So, they should make these changes.

The reason why is when you have very -- lot of volatile markets and very widespread and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks themselves. And anyway -- and we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate the markets, help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no -- basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",264,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,43,Jeremy Barnum,"And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were in fact bound by us alone as a result of the expansion of deposit base and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So, we've seen when it is binding and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed.

I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed and there are interactions among all these things, and we as a bank are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch.",159,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,44,Steven Chubak,"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty, but was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses, which have been performing extraordinarily well of late. And just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters?",84,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,45,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level, but the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk that could be a headwind for us. So, we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we're certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.",137,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,46,Steven Chubak,That's great. Thank you both for taking my questions.,9,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,47,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.,16,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,48,Gerard Cassidy,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Can you guys share with us, if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III endgame proposal came out in July of '23, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where the customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility?",86,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,49,Jeremy Barnum,"I mean, it's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of your question aligns with what we've been saying about the space for some time, which is, we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche direct lending-type structure, we're open for business for all of it.

And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source -- the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders and serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment, that will be great.",191,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,50,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads, that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?",90,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,51,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah. I mean, Gerard, we always say this and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole. And that was true before and it's true now with this administration as well.

Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So, let's see how that plays out, but we're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively.",152,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,52,Jamie Dimon,"Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system. And there should be -- and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.",29,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,53,Gerard Cassidy,Very good. Thank you.,4,Analyst

2025Q1,April 11 2025,55,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.,16,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,56,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you will have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates? Are the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs, is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?",125,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,57,Jamie Dimon,"First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all of that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him in the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with -- around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle, they're not going to be -- trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.",135,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,58,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Got it. And I guess, as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of week. Just your comfort level in terms of the functioning of the treasury market? Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Any color would be great.",67,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,59,Jamie Dimon,"Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you, I don't think that's going to go away and that relates to that. Obviously, the US dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed -- we've been consistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently it happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened, that will happen and then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we don't know if and when that's going to happen and we'll see.

But the notion that the 10-year treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, we have huge global deficits back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter, tariffs, at least our economists think, will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So, we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",214,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,60,Ebrahim Poonawala,Thank you.,2,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,61,Jamie Dimon,For most -- mostly we haven't dealt with this stuff before and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months and then we'll know.,33,CEO

2025Q1,April 11 2025,64,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on with four -- three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about the trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into '26? Just trying to think of that -- around that trajectory and jumping off point into next year.",65,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,65,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah. It's funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call how come we're not like suspending guidance or whatever, and my answer was like, well, whatever [the guidance] (ph), we do our best and it's contingent on a variety of external variables and we always make our guidance contingent on that. So -- and that comes...",58,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,66,Jamie Dimon,"The yield curve you're using, which we know will not happen.",11,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,67,Jeremy Barnum,"And the particular nuance as you recall from last quarter where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook, including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it's both the timing of rates and the -- our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how evolved and how that was all going to interact, producing potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth.

I think that given everything that's going on, on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the back-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run rate perspective introduce a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year, we'll just have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters.",147,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,68,Jim Mitchell,Right. And maybe just...,4,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,69,Jamie Dimon,It will not happen that way. And we have a lot of options and we want to do change our exposure to interest rate.,24,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,70,Jim Mitchell,"Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive -- as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?",55,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,71,Jeremy Barnum,"It's a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposit this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So, I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess that.",57,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,72,Jamie Dimon,"I'll just also say that it may not be deposits, it may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen, which is different, is not the risk-off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.",40,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,73,Jim Mitchell,Right. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.,7,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,74,Jeremy Barnum,Thanks.,1,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,75,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.,15,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,76,Betsy Graseck,"Thanks. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jeremy. Two questions, one for Jamie to kick off. Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?",80,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,77,Jamie Dimon,"Again, almost impossible to answer. We look at all the cycles. We prepare for a full range of outcomes. So, not -- I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold, but I do -- I pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months. So, maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that.

But it's -- the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down. It looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know. But we are -- I've been quite cautious and you can see it in our capital, liquidity, our position, our balance sheet, and so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.",220,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,78,Betsy Graseck,"Excellent. Okay. No, thank you for that. And then...",9,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,79,Jamie Dimon,"So, Betsy, this is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy and please read my Chairman's letter, the most important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for democracy. That is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean, and I -- the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change we've never seen in our lives.",145,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,80,Betsy Graseck,"Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming.

So, then, one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year, and then end-of-period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So, I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter-end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity, do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market that'd be helpful too. Thank you.",117,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,81,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah. It's a good question, Betsy. So, a couple of things. One is, in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on [shoring up] (ph) liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws -- meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now.

Yeah, so on wholesale loans, beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now, we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's another hurdle there.

Did you -- yeah, you asked -- what did you ask, also front end of the yield curve liquidity?",175,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,82,Betsy Graseck,"Yeah, just in money markets, fed funds, the front-end seem to suggest...",12,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,83,Jeremy Barnum,Yeah. What we've heard from our markets colleagues is that that's actually functioning quite smoothly.,15,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,84,Betsy Graseck,Okay. Thank you.,3,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,85,Jeremy Barnum,Thanks.,1,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,86,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.,16,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,87,Mike Mayo,"Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a ""deep recognition of flaws"" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put -- you or Jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid as much as red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you'd pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation?

But before that, the negative which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman letter about the trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars ""get over it"" to this week say ""do something."" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened? And do you really think next earnings call will be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",170,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,88,Jamie Dimon,"Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about to ""get over it,"" I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it.

You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade. So -- and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of -- obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about ""get over it."" I did not change my view about it.

I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too. Maybe the extent they want to do it, they said they're having conversations with 70 or 80 different people. And so, I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system.

And I don't -- I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see, okay? There will be thousands -- hundreds of people maybe, but it's not going to be [passed on] (ph), but it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages if it's done right.

I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing that right now.",274,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,89,Mike Mayo,"No. And you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the CET1 ratio, I guess, back down by one-fifth. So...",26,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,90,Jamie Dimon,"If you do all -- if you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%. And the reason for that isn't -- it's not just capital. It is also LCR. It is also G-SIFIs.

And the question you should ask, because you are very smart, Mike, is could you -- have the same -- and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to the First Republic of Silicon Valley, and you can accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen.

You can read our -- I think our [MPRs] (ph) are public and stuff like that. And so, they should do that, just make a better system. We have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. And if you don't -- I'd say, when you look at these rules and regulations, see Europe. If that's where we want to go, let's just go there.",244,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,91,Mike Mayo,"One short follow-up. Just first quarter, you mentioned good credit, good trading, good [EPSB] (ph). I'm not sure anyone cares. They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international US company during trade wars, and I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers, so how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.",111,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,92,Jamie Dimon,"Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us, but I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and we'll just have to deal with that.",57,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,93,Mike Mayo,All right. Thank you.,4,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,94,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.,15,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,95,Glenn Schorr,"Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree flawed regulatory system could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are you -- are the systems better? Are they better able to handle it as your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",97,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,96,Jeremy Barnum,"I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive, meaning I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so, we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So, I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago as I think probably everyone is at the margin.

I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully. And to your point, I think your specific question of like, is there -- are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So, people make fun of the kind of good volatility/bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier, we're happy to see that.",218,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,97,Jamie Dimon,"Jeremy -- I agree with Jeremy. I'd add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid/ask spreads that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes, so you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps and a whole bunch of different things, treasuries, that's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you're seeing in DCM today, when you don't have bond deals, when you have less trading, when you have -- so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients. So, we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads go up or down and pretty bad.

But the plumbing of the system, I would say, the plumbing worked well during COVID, too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and it wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had. So -- but you're always worried about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",204,CEO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,98,Jeremy Barnum,"And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good, shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie has been talking about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel thing, MRWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts as we've often talked about and is miscalibrated. It will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as a policy priority.",97,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,99,Glenn Schorr,That's a great point. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.,9,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,100,Jeremy Barnum,"Thanks, Glenn.",2,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,101,Operator,Thank you. And our final question will go to the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. You may proceed.,19,Operator
2025Q1,April 11 2025,102,Saul Martinez,"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess, how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts? If you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn, I think you do have -- in the $95 billion guidance, you do have good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you -- does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments or do you think that's just completely short sighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy?",138,Analyst
2025Q1,April 11 2025,103,Jeremy Barnum,"Yeah. So, you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So, let me unpack it a little bit. So, the way I think about it is, there are some elements of the expense base, which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So, we talk about those as volume and revenue related expense. And so, you will see those come down as a function of the environment.

It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyzed them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so, if, for whatever reason, the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust.

Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling through our traditional long-term investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company.

This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is, how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook. But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy. So that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic of...",344,CFO
2025Q1,April 11 2025,104,Jamie Dimon,"As you said management thing, because I think it's very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses, and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off. And -- but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can imagine -- if you go to -- if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail.

And so, there is -- we're making a -- I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID, the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the -- and Mike Mayo mentioned the thing about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit.

I mean, we -- I pointed out resolution recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long, okay? It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long, okay? We report 1 trillion -- I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the -- all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we -- that hopefully we can get rid of and reduce the cost of the system and -- but it's not new branches. So, the folks here are working on, we call, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that. So -- and we're having fun doing it. It's like -- to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so -- and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.",386,CEO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,1,Operator,Our first question will come from Christopher McGratty with QBW (sic) [ KBW ].,14,Operator
2025Q2,July 15 2025,2,Christopher Edward McGratty,"Jamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to?

And secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?",78,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,3,Jeremy Barnum,"Let me take the second part of that first. So we have our standard capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right?

So we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so we've talked about how excess capital is earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having organic capital generation to be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion.

So we're doing what we want to do, but clearly, it is a big amount of excess, and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things.

Now obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it.

I don't particularly think other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",288,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,4,Jamie Dimon,"And Chris, just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture, so nothing has happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that.

And then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing.

And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for America? And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.",308,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,5,Jeremy Barnum,"And maybe sort of gone a bit long here, but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there. I will note that Vice Chair Bowman gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work on regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we can do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly needs to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that, that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important.

More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that if all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold-plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect.

And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit under discussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strongest incentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is seems to be the exact opposite of what we want. So that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say.",261,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,6,Christopher Edward McGratty,"I appreciate all the color. If I could ask kind of a follow-up. The inorganic comments. I'm interested in capital allocation between your businesses, where you think, if that were to present an opportunity where -- which businesses would most likely be the use of that capital?",47,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,7,Jeremy Barnum,"I mean we've talked about that a little bit over time. Obviously, we're not fundamentally capital constrained right now. So I mean in addition to the fact that capital isn't the only financial resource that we need to allocate, I would say the larger point is that any good franchise business that it makes sense from a risk perspective and clears the cost of equity is going to get done within reason, subject to obvious caveat. So...",77,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,8,Jamie Dimon,"Inorganic, it's a good discipline to always be looking. I would have high expectations that will be how we use a lot of capital. And I think it's a very big plus that we grow organically in every business we're in without having to stretch.",45,CEO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,10,Betsy Lynn Graseck,"So two questions. First, on the RWA utilization via organic as you described. I wanted to understand in wholesale lending, where you highlighted the CIB was a driver of much of this. Could you speak to the drivers of those drivers? In other words, is it private credit? Is it M&A financing? Is it inventory? What are you seeing in the market here that you're delivering on that's raising that lending profile?",72,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,11,Jeremy Barnum,"It's all of the above, Betsy, because we are the Switzerland of financing. We do everything, and we saw a lot of activity come in late in the quarter.",29,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,12,Betsy Lynn Graseck,"Okay. Great. All right. And then Jamie, you've -- there's been a lot of discussion around stablecoin. How stablecoin is going to be impacting banks. And I believe you have an opinion on this, would love to hear if you could highlight how JPM is thinking about utilizing, leveraging, competing with stablecoin, and how the JPMD deposit token feeds into all of this as well?",65,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,13,Jamie Dimon,"So deposit token is effectively the same thing. You're moving money by token, you could pay interest. It's JPMorgan deposit. And stablecoins, we're going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it.

We don't know exactly -- I think they're real, but I don't know why you'd want a stablecoin as opposed to just a payment. And -- but I do think you have fintech, these guys are very smart. I'm trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts to get the payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved. We're going to be in it and learning a lot and player.",128,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,14,Betsy Lynn Graseck,"Okay, super. And then separately on the topic of open banking. I think that's on hold right now with the CFPB, on hold right now. But just wanted to understand, does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here?",51,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,15,Jamie Dimon,"So this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer. So we think the customer has the right to, if they want to share their information. What we asked people to do is, what are they -- do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It should be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because somebody of these things going on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so we're kind of in favor of all that done properly.

And then the payment, it just -- it costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system protection. So we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it.

The last thing is a liability shift. I mean I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that.

And if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third-party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility in their part. So we can all do a better job for the customer. That's why.",255,CEO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,17,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"I wanted to start, Jeremy, going back to your comments on inorganic things being on the table in terms of use of excess capital. So when I look at the company, so you're the largest U.S. bank by assets, you're also the largest in terms of the data you see every day. And you may or may not have seen that Apple is looking at possibly, there's chatter, getting into the AI game more by looking at a company such as Perplexity.

Just thinking out loud here, would it make sense for JPMorgan to consider acquiring an LLM, right? The last 2 quarters of buybacks are about the last valuation round for Perplexity, right? I'm thinking of you guys, you could become LLM for the financial services industry. What are your thoughts on this?",134,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,18,Jamie Dimon,"We use LLMs and we're going to be agnostic about that, too. There's no reason for us to own one. At least we can't figure out why that would make sense. And I wouldn't -- we will use it, and we will obviously be important in using our data to help our customers.",53,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,19,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. And on the question of inorganic deployment, I would sort of blend my comments with Jamie's right? In the end, I'm just asserting that, of course, we need to look at inorganic opportunities. And of course, that's a question that comes up given our current excess capital position. But Jamie said clearly that he doesn't think that's particularly likely, or some of the reasons that you emphasized, it's not easy to imagine a deal that would actually make sense.",80,CFO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,21,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"Yes. Yes. Okay. And then going back, Jamie, to your answer to Betsy's question on the tokenized deposit. I get it, how that makes sense in terms of the customers that are inside your walled garden, but it doesn't help them much in terms of dealing with customers outside of your garden. What's holding up you guys and the other banks getting together to issue something joint, similar to what you've done with Zelle and prevent these stablecoin companies like Circle coming in and offering a more convenient solution to your customers?",92,Analyst

But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release, give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the U.S., what's the state of play there?

Just what's your take based on all the data that we all look at?",84,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,27,Jamie Dimon,"You can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We've built, I think 500 bank of the innovation economy, which is kind of new to us. I think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business, regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next 6 to 9 months.",114,CEO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,30,Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala,"And I was just wondering in terms of your sense of just the state of play, the health of the balance sheets of these customers. And also if you can expand that into the consumer, any areas of stress from a credit quality perspective that you're beginning to get more concerned today versus 3 or 6 months ago?",58,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,31,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes, right. Okay. Because that's what I was going to try to clarify. I just wasn't sure if you were doing consumer wholesale or both. So let's do consumer quickly. I think -- we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just -- the consumer basically seems to be fine.

Now a few things are true. Like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands. But that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations. You saw that we kept our net charge-off guidance unchanged. So all that looks kind of fine. And to be honest, as we've said before, fundamentally, while there are nuances around the edges, consumer credit is primarily about labor markets. And in a world with 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio to see a lot of weakness.

Now it is true that if you look at, not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day, like first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent with the sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing.

Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period. So it's kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions, but nothing particularly concerning.",337,CFO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,33,Jeremy Barnum,"I mean, basically, yes, you see some idiosyncratic things here and there. And on the point of tariffs, I guess, obviously, you recall the slide that we did at Investor Day, kind of highlighting that different sectors are going to have different experiences as a function of their margins, their sensitivity to input cost, their amount of pricing power, their amount of leverage, and where the rules actually land. But people are obviously getting some time to adjust, and we're watching it very closely. So we'll see.",87,CFO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,35,John Eamon McDonald,"Jeremy, a quick follow-up on the consumer credit, broader comments taken there. But in terms of the NPAs, the nonaccruals in consumers seem to have a bit of a jump. Is there something technical there? Maybe just talk to that.",40,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,36,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. Thanks for that, John. I'm glad to get a chance to clarify this. There is something technical, which has to do with customers in the -- Home Lending customers in the L.A. area, using our forbearance availability as a result of the wildfires. So that is resulting in an

uptick in the nonperforming. But when you think about land value, and the insurance there, the actual loss expectation is de minimis, I would say. So...",76,CFO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,38,Jeremy Barnum,Exactly. So that's what's driving that one.,7,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,39,John Eamon McDonald,Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits. Maybe in the context of Marianne's presentation from Investor Day. Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper single-digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about?,56,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,40,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes, sure. So I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number. And as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal.

The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step by step. So you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. I think that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield- seeking flows. With the yield-seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us, or increasingly behind us. And you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in Consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers.

And then as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. Now obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things.

You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates, which perhaps somewhat non-intuitively would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield-seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true, which is an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal in consumer. So we'd like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",344,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,41,Operator,"Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.",13,Operator
2025Q2,July 15 2025,42,Michael Lawrence Mayo,"Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography?

And Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal.",49,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,43,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise, and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the

Corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for the smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general.

But as I noted, I think previously, and as you see coming through the IBP performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public. And some of that is on our balance sheet, and we're very happy to have it there.",157,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,44,Jamie Dimon,"And to answer your other question, Mike. So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second.

So G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and stuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book.

And when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",263,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,45,Michael Lawrence Mayo,You didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there?,16,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,46,Jamie Dimon,"Yes, and I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things can reduce the actual cost of making loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we've just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.",93,CEO

And I also think you may have seen peak private credit a little bit. I don't know that. But we already do it. So if it was the right people at the right price, then I'm sure we should look at it. I think, Mike, you should always be open-minded when people come to you with something you hadn't thought about before. And you just get smarter by looking at these things.",93,CEO

But you might -- your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us, natural fit being product and people and culture.",85,CEO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,57,Erika Najarian,"Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?",103,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,58,Jamie Dimon,"In a competitive world, it is irrational to thing that -- and when it applies to all the competitors that everyone is just going to make a lot more money to keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.",113,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,59,Jeremy Barnum,"Exactly. And as we always said, Erika, right, like the market is very competitive, and the returns are high. And you know this, but I would just refer you to the slide that I delivered at Investor Day about how in some cases, it makes all else equal, compared to buying back shares at these prices, doing healthy, well-underwritten, compelling franchise business with a 14% return, we're definitely supposed to do that actually. And if we do a lot of that, it will dilute down the weighted average ROTCE of the company in ways that are nonetheless clearly accretive to shareholders. So...",102,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,60,Jamie Dimon,"And Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. Now they should do a low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff, if you didn't do, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns. That we just -- we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches, that does our private bank or things like that.",87,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,61,Erika Najarian,"Yes, for sure. And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement.

And the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly, we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it -- does activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels, or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?",147,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,62,Jamie Dimon,"Jeremy, you might want to -- I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. And so that lesson we've learned over and over, it may stay wide open for 1.5 years. Something may happen geopolitically that all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yes, you're going to have really active markets.",87,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,63,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. And my version of that, Erika, I would be to say that you talked about certain of the tail risk getting taken completely off the table, and that's clearly not true, right? All the tail risks are all still there quite prominently. And in many cases, in the daily news flow, maybe at the margin, the tails are a little bit less fat right now.

I think it's also true that in terms of our -- what the things that we've said about our Investment Banking pipeline have been consistently quite cautious. And at a certain point, when you have the type of outperformance that you have this quarter, starts to make your cautiousness, seem less credible. So we wanted to take a hard look at ourselves and say, what do we really think. And it's like, yes, the sentiment is better. But as Jamie says, like that can change overnight, and there are a lot of risks.",159,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,64,Jamie Dimon,"I do think that extending the tax bill for business to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done.

I also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial Liberation Day, now there's more talk as more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed, that reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1.",104,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,65,Operator,"Next, we will go to the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.",14,Operator
2025Q2,July 15 2025,66,James Francis Mitchell,"Maybe just on, Jeremy, if I look at your 10-Q and 10-K rate sensitivity disclosures, it looks like you guys have done a lot to reduce your asset sensitivity to the short end of the curve. So can you talk about what you've been doing to change the positioning of the balance sheet, whether extending duration or hedges? And is there more you can do to desensitize the balance sheet before rate cuts begin to kick in as, I guess, the markets expect later this year?",86,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,67,Jamie Dimon,"Before he goes on, look, what the market expects almost never happens.",12,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,68,James Francis Mitchell,Fair enough.,2,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,69,Jeremy Barnum,"All right. So it's a good question, Jim. But yes, as Jamie points out, just remember that to the extent that the market is sufficient, which maybe it's not, but you can't really hedge ahead of cuts that are already priced in, right? So that's what I'm saying out loud.

But I mean you can decrease volatility, but it's just a question of now or later. But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did, in fact, add some duration this quarter with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve, which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes in like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII.

As we've talked about a little bit over time, though, I like the way you framed it in terms of like having the capacity. And I think the way to think about it there is that in general, it's almost impossible to get your assets -- for a bank like us, it's almost impossible to get your asset sensitivity, your actual asset sensitivity down to 0, because you wind up constrained by other things. So we're in the corridor, and we're okay with where we are right now.",245,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,70,James Francis Mitchell,"Okay. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators looked at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks, or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheet into lower-risk assets. Do you see that -- is it really just a supply issue? Or how do you think about the demand/supply dynamic? And is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower-margin areas? Just your thoughts.",88,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,71,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. It's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll more or less repeat my answer here, which is that as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want from these backstop measures. And so we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crises. It's just not the right way to run the railroad.

I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed. But it's a good sign that it's now out there, and we certainly support the proposal. There are some nuances that comment have been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal. It's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons.

But yes, as you noted, and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity, which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low- risk intermediation in the market-making businesses, which is maybe where you would hope to see the effect.

In terms of strategic aspects of this and the competitive landscape, I think the way we think about this is as a normal course refresh of one of our important products in the way that all of our products get refreshed periodically. Obviously, this is a relatively high-profile product. Many of us have the Card. We see the ads everywhere. So it sort of punches above its weight in that respect in terms of visibility.

In terms of the competitive landscape, I think the thing that we feel really great about is the dramatic increase in the customer value proposition associated with the Card. And in particular, one of the things that we look at is the ratio of the customer value to the annual fee, which is clearly market leading at this point. So...",139,CFO

But it's not like I thought it would do badly, but it sort of did quite well in the volatility in the first half of the quarter and then it got quiet. But despite that, we still did nicely. And I think the point actually, sort of to your question is that, yes, we are seeing opportunities to deploy capital and other resources. And yes, maybe at the margin, that does contribute a little bit to durability.

We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. I mean, obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway. But we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate. And then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again.

But the thing I'd like to remind myself of to your point, is that while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot. So we are deploying a lot of capital and all the resources in this business, and we're earning good returns on it. But the revenue growth is not coming for free.

2025Q2,July 15 2025,102,Jeremy Barnum,"Okay. I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn.

So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital, which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happens this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping

about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage, which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact. So that's all to the good in some sense.

No one is going to convince me that's a brilliant thing to do, but it is wise to use our balance sheet for customers, which we're doing. And we can maybe possibly do more. And it is probably wise to not increase the excess capital anymore since we have plenty, and it's going to be going up.

But look, I'm completely convinced if you take out of your mindset 12 months. We will use the capital wisely for shareholders.

2025Q2,July 15 2025,107,Gerard Sean Cassidy,"I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the onetime effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is.

And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was guidance -- guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some onetime -- not onetime items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially -- I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE, which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",155,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,108,Jamie Dimon,"Jeremy, you can answer this one. I just might add really be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we cannot just earn 17% ROTCE is that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17% you're a bond, then you will trade at 3x tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing.

If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers internationally. And when we look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe is it's been great. Innovation economy has been great. We're gaining shares in a lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the international -- payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that is the best way to use it.",171,CEO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,109,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. And Gerard, I guess, on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable. And I feel like it's kind of all of the above. And let me say what I mean.

Like on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right? Rates are at a good level for us. Deal activity is high. Capital markets are very strong. Consumer credit is excellent. Wholesale credit is excellent. Wealth Management, Asset Management. I mean essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market.

So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse. And that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable.

On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well. And we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside, there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie is talking about. Some of those investments in various ways are paying off. So...",259,CFO
2025Q2,July 15 2025,110,Jamie Dimon,"You have all of our major bank competitors are back, rolling and expanding.

And we keep on realizing -- you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day.

And so we're quite cautious to just declare victory, like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, because I had Jeremy do this number one point, if you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America -- for 40 years maybe.",165,CEO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,120,Saul Martinez,"Just one for me, I just want to follow up on Ken's question about sales and trading. And I think you kind of addressed this, Jeremy. But I just -- you had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional Q1 on the back of really strong 2024.

I mean how are you thinking about how much of this is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable? And presumably less volatility, good for Investment Banking, but do you see -- would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result? Or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share? Just curious how much -- how you think about what's exceptional versus what's more durable here?",132,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,121,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. I mean one thing I'll say is that there's no like weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter are driving the results. So it's pretty broad-based. And it's not like particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases, to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns. But it's sort of -- it's not just like growing without any inputs essentially. So I guess, on the one hand, you might say that, that's a bit more durable for that reason. But it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources essentially.

So I mean, we've gotten over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues. It's obviously extremely client-centric. There's a lot of financing of various types that's being supplied. And it seems to, if anything, more often than not be countercyclical rather than procyclical. But it's still Markets, right? Things can happen. It's volatile, there's risk taking involved. That's part of the point that -- sorry to hedge the answer, but that's kind of how we think about it.",232,CFO

2025Q2,July 15 2025,123,Christoph M. Kotowski,"Kind of an old-school bank analyst question. After a long time of kind of bemoaning slow C&I loan growth, you had this extraordinary growth this quarter, $33 billion on average and more than 6% quarter-over-quarter. But then when we look at the P&L in the Commercial & Investment Bank, net interest income is down 2% and lending income is down 4%. And I know there's hedges and other complicated things, but it just kind of doesn't compute that you'd have such strong loan growth and not have revenue growth associated with that.",92,Analyst
2025Q2,July 15 2025,124,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. I mean the hedges are definitely part of it. And a lot of the assets came on the balance sheet quite late in the quarter. So I don't know, I might be missing something. And there's probably some Markets NII piece of it, too.

2025Q3,October 14 2025,2,John McDonald,"Thanks for the initial outlook on the 2026 NII. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about the retail deposit assumptions that were embedded in that. At Investor Day, you discussed an expectation for deposits to grow 3% year-over-year by the fourth quarter and I think accelerating to 6% next year. It looks like they were flat this quarter. So I just wanted to see if you're still expecting those kind of previously expected growth rates of 3% and 6%.",78,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,3,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. Good question, John. Thanks for that. So yes, you're referring specifically to a page that was presented at Investor Day by Marianne for the CCB with some illustrative scenarios for what we might expect CCB deposit growth to do as a function of some different potential macroeconomic scenarios. And in the kind of then prevailing central case scenario, you can say we had 3% growth in the fourth quarter of this year and 6% projected for 2026.

So as we sit here right now and we sort of update the macro environment, a few things are true. One is the personal savings rate is a little bit lower than expected. Consumer spending remained robust, while income was a bit lower. So that's all else equal, decreasing balances per account in CCB. And as you obviously know, equity market performance has been particularly strong, which is driving flows into investments, and we are capturing that in our Wealth Management business. But again, that's a little bit of a headwind balances per account.

And relative to the scenario that we had at the time, rates are a little bit higher than what was in the forwards, and that is producing, again, slightly higher than otherwise expected yield-seeking flow. They're still below the peak but they're still a factor.

So as we look forward from here, the drivers are still in place. So if you break it down, a key driver is obviously ongoing net new accounts. And if you look at this quarter, it's been strong with over 400,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. And so what you're left with is just the question of how that average balance per customer evolves and when you hit the inflection point of that number based on the factors that we've just gone through. And so at the margin, that kind of upward inflection point has been pushed out a little bit.

But at a high level, we remain kind of quite confident about the overall long-term trajectory here and optimistic but the macro environment shift has just slightly pushed out some of the growth inflection dynamics.",354,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,4,John McDonald,"Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just sticking with that 2026 initial outlook. What are some of the other key assumptions in there, particularly around commercial deposits and maybe loan growth and rates?",33,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,5,Jeremy Barnum,"Sure. Yes. So as we always do, we're using the current forward curves as of September 30. So that has whatever the relevant cuts are, I think the impact of the 75 basis points of cuts this year, and I think as of the end of September, it was 25 basis point cuts in the first half of 2026. So that, all else equal, is obviously a headwind as we remain asset sensitive and the annualization of this year and the first half of next year. And then offsetting that, you have all the growth dynamics, which include card revolve growth, which has been obviously a significant tailwind but it's going to slow down a little bit given that the normalization of revolve is close to complete now but we still see very healthy acquisition dynamics there. So that will be a growth driver, albeit a little bit lower.

And similarly, I mean, pivoting a little bit to deposits for a second. We just talked about the contribution of deposit balance growth to that, which will be a factor. In Wholesale deposits, it was a very strong growth year this year. So we would expect it to be a little bit more muted next year but the core franchise is doing great. And then wholesale loan growth will kind of be what it is but the trends there are solid. So it's the usual mix of rate headwinds offsetting balanced growth and mix. So we'll refine it more next quarter, and we'll see how it goes.",256,CFO

2025Q3,October 14 2025,7,Glenn Schorr,"I wanted to drill down a little bit more on credit. And you gave us enough, I think, on the Consumer side. You noted the idiosyncratic names on the broadly syndicated side. So maybe if we could step back and say, you're a big player in obviously, everything, broadly syndicated loans, high-yield markets and increasingly on the private debt side. So my question is both of demand and credit fundamentals, what are you seeing in terms of drivers of client demand there on the lending side on the Wholesale front? And then importantly, are you seeing differentiated credit fundamentals across public and private markets because there's been a lot of discussion about that lately, and I feel like you're like in the best position to help us.",127,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,8,Jeremy Barnum,"Okay. I'll do my best to try to help. So let me just get one thing out of the way because you were sort of polite enough not to touch on it but I already kind of disclosed it on the press call. We generally, as you know, Glenn, are not in the habit of talking about individual borrower situations. But given the amount of public attention the Tricolor thing has gotten in particular, I think it's worth just saying that, that's contributing $170 million of charge-offs in the quarter, which we call out on the wholesale side. Also worth noting, there's been a lot of attention on the First Brands situation. We don't have any exposure to them. So anyway, that's just worth getting out of the way.

So you asked about demand and you asked about public-private differentiation. On the demand side, I really think -- I mean, not to overuse the phrase but from the perspective of our franchise, this kind of moment of revived animal spirits, let's say, is driving demand. We're seeing very healthy deal flow. We're seeing acquisition finance come back. Obviously, we were very involved in a particularly large deal this quarter. And I would say broadly, and maybe this goes a little bit also to the public private point, our kind of product-agnostic credit strategy across the whole continuum is playing out very nicely. And I think some of the events of the quarter prove that like when you've got something big to do, we're the right people to call and we'll give you the best solution across a very complete full product suite.

You asked whether we're seeing differentiation in fundamentals between private and public spaces. I don't know. I haven't heard that particularly. I think it probably depends a little bit on how you define the spaces and what you're differentiating. Like obviously, to make the obvious point, like subprime auto has been a challenging space for people in that industry but that's probably not quite what you meant by private credit. And I haven't heard anything to suggest that the private deals are performing differently from the public deals.

It probably is true at the margin that some of the new direct lending initiatives involve underwriting at slightly higher expected losses, and that's significant because as we've been discussing here, the wholesale charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. And I think simply having that normalized would produce some increases in wholesale charge-offs. And obviously, as we've been discussing a lot in consumer over the last couple of years, when you're in that normalization moment, you're constantly wondering, is this normalization or have we switched to deterioration.

I don't know if we're seeing that yet in Wholesale but it's also worth noting that the current portfolio is going to have a slightly different mix from what we have had over the last 10 or 15 years. And so the expected charge-off rate is going to be a little bit higher, all else equal but obviously, that comes with appropriate revenues and returns.",517,CFO

2025Q3,October 14 2025,10,Betsy Graseck,"One follow-up on that is on the reserve build. I know that you mentioned largely due to card loan growth. But could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the reserve that you have against the commercial book, especially given what you just mentioned around the mix of the portfolio is different today than it was prior cycle, I'm thinking prior cycle means pre-COVID but let me know if it's a different time frame that you're thinking about.",82,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,11,Jeremy Barnum,"Well, I mean, I think we were thinking the entire post-GFC era. I think a couple of Investor Days ago, we put up a slide showing that wholesale charge-off rate over 10 years. I might be wrong but from memory, it was like 0 on a net basis, which is obviously not reasonable going forward. But on your narrow question about the reserve, I think you've actually seen that a little bit. I mean, maybe it doesn't pop in the consolidated numbers. But in some of the recent quarters, as we've sort of started doing some more of these direct lending deals, when we put those deals on the books, they come with quite significant day 1 reserve balances.

So in the normal course, that growth comes with healthy reserves. And hopefully, we get the underwriting right, and we got all that money back, obviously. So -- but yes, as you well know, our entire Wholesale reserve methodology is highly granular and very specific. And so to the extent that the mix shifts, the loan growth will come with slightly higher reserve intensity, but that will be situation by situation.",190,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,12,Betsy Graseck,"Okay. Perfect. And then just the follow-up is on how you're thinking about your excess capital utilization. I know yesterday you had the press release on leaning into industries that are critical for U.S. security, et cetera. And maybe you could speak a little bit to that incremental $500 billion, is it that you're talking about, supporting growth of over the next 10 years relative to the potential for a dividend hike. I mean you could do both, obviously. But I did just want to understand the press release yesterday in that context as well as the opportunity set for a dividend hike.",103,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,13,Jeremy Barnum,"Sure, fine. And yes, you kind of answered your own question a little bit and that like it is kind of an all of the above thing. Although obviously, we're not going to give forward guidance on buybacks or dividend policy. But as you know, yes, we're generating a lot of organic capital. We have a very large access. We've kind of said that we wanted to rush the growth of the access. We've more or less done that since we set it. And that's actually enabling us -- well -- and in the meantime, we've actually grown RWA quite a bit, which has resulted in some actual decreases in the CET1 ratio.

So -- as we all know, we don't love buying back the stock at these levels but we want to keep the excess reasonable. And in the meantime, we're using our financial resources to lend into the real economy very broadly across the entire franchise. And yes, yesterday's press release is an extension of that. So both, in terms of what we were already going to do in the normal course plus an aspiration to add another $0.5 trillion of this type of lending at the margin. That's the type of RWA growth that consumes excess. And obviously, in the context of the excess, $10 billion of direct equity investments that are incremental is a nice deployment of a modest portion of the excess. And obviously, it's not going to happen instantaneously. So I think all of the above is probably the short answer to your question.",260,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,14,Operator,"Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.",14,Operator
2025Q3,October 14 2025,15,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess maybe, Jamie, a broader question, like when we read the quote from Jamie in the press release, customers are resilient, but there's still massive amounts of uncertainty. I'm just wondering if based on what you see, both Commercial versus Consumer, are things getting better as we look into '26? Or does it feel like we are at a tipping point where we could see a slump in unemployment over the coming months that then leads to concerns around the credit cycle. Just if there's a bias that you have on how things could play out, that would be helpful color.",102,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,16,Jeremy Barnum,"Sure. I mean, Jamie may have his own personal opinions here but I think that at a high level, the story that we're trying to tell is one that's anchored on the current facts. And the current facts on the consumer side is that the consumer is resilient, spending is strong and delinquency rates are actually coming in below expectations. So those are facts that we really can't escape.

Now talking to our economists, I was struck by something that Mike Farley said about thinking about the current labor market in this moment of what people are describing as a low hiring, low firing moment. You can think of that as potentially explained by employers experiencing high uncertainty. and so if you believe that and you think about This moment as a moment of high uncertainty, I think tipping point is a little bit too strong a word. But certainly, as you look ahead, there are risks. We already have slowing growth. There are a variety of challenges and sources of volatility and uncertainty. And so it's pretty easy to imagine a world where the labor market deteriorates from here. And if that happens, obviously, as you will know, we're going to see worse consumer credit performance.

So I wouldn't say we're pounding the table with this view but we're just noting as we always do, that there are risks and that the fact that things are fine now doesn't mean they're guaranteed to be great forever.",247,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,17,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Among shareholders, whether AI and AI-driven productivity gains mean something for the banks as we look out over the next 2 to 3 years. You all have obviously talked about this at the Investor Day. I'm just trying to contextualize when you talk about the expense growth outlook or just sort of preliminary indication for next year, how should bank shareholders think about AI-led productivity gains in terms of making a dent on the expense growth either next year or for the next few years?",85,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,18,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. So I'll give you my personal opinion about this. I certainly would presume to tell people how to think about this at the system as a whole. But I think the risk is because of how incredibly overwhelming the AI theme is for the whole marketplace right now and all the various effects that it's having in terms of equity market performance, MAG 7, data center build-out, electricity costs, like it's an overwhelming thing. And I think for us, running a company of this type, we need to make sure we stay anchored in like facts and reality and tangible outcomes. So we're putting a lot of energy into this. A lot of people are spending a lot of time on it.

We're spending a lot of money on it. We have very deep experts. As Jamie always says, we've been doing it for a long time, well before the current generative AI boom. But in the end, the proof is going to be in the pudding in terms of actually slowing the growth of expenses. And so what we're doing is kind of rather than saying you must prove that you're generating this much savings from AI, which turns out to be a very hard thing to do, hard to prove and might, at the margin result in people scrambling around to use AI in ways that are actually not efficient and that distract you from doing underlying process reengineering that you need to do.

What we're saying instead is let's just do old-fashioned expense discipline and constrain people's growth, constrain people's headcount growth. We've talked about that last year. We're going to do the same this year, have a very strong bias against having the reflective response to any given need to be to hire more people and feeling a little bit more confident on our ability to put that pressure on the organization because we know that even if we can't always measure it that precisely, there are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.

So that's how we're going to do it. And hopefully, that will show up in lower growth than we would have had otherwise. But a lot of the drivers of growth, which are per capita labor inflation and revenue-related expense and investments are always going to be there. We're never going to stop doing those things. So that's how we think about it.",400,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,19,Operator,Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,11,Operator
2025Q3,October 14 2025,20,Michael Mayo,"If I could get an answer to this from both you, Jeremy, and Jamie, the question really is how much of a risk is the lending to the NDFIs? Just -- I mean, because you guys are always outfront highlighting what could happen, whether it's cyber or as you point, labor market or inflation. And I feel like you haven't really highlighted this as a potential risk area. Maybe that's because you don't perceive it as such, but you have Tricolor, you have First Brands. One area of your biggest growth, I think, has been NDFIs over the last year.

So I'm just trying to put this in some sort of context that as it relates to Tricolor, who bears the losses? Does end investors in the funds? Is it -- do you put skin in the game and have your own investments? Are you an underwriter? Where are you exposed? So I guess I'm asking JPMorgan specifically but then Jamie more generally for the industry. Is this something that's flashing yellow that you are spending more time on? How should we think about that?",185,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,21,Jeremy Barnum,"Right. So let me do what you asked, Mike, and put a little bit of context around this. So a couple -- let's do some housekeeping first. So you talked about Tricolor, you talked about First Brands. I just want to reiterate, we do not have any exposure to First Brands. On Tricolor, it represents $170 million of the wholesale charge-off this quarter. Obviously, by definition, that reflects on-balance sheet loans that we're charging off. And with respect to other exposures, I don't really have anything additional to say about that at this point. It will play out as it plays out. But in the normal course, we're always quite conservative about taking all possible hits that we can based on what's knowable upfront. So take that for whatever it's worth.

More generally, I think one thing that's important to say in terms of context about NBFI lending is that the vast majority of that type of lending that we do is highly secured or in some way, structured or securitized. In other words, it's not like we're doing extremely high-risk, low-rated lending for the NBFI community. And so that doesn't mean that there's no risk. That doesn't mean that things can't go wrong. And obviously, if you're doing secured lending and there are problems with the collateral, that's an issue, which is clearly relevant in the case of Tricolor. So -- and we've talked a lot about the question about risk inside the regulated perimeter versus risk outside the perimeter.

But we've also acknowledged that a lot of the private credit actors are large, very sophisticated, very good at credit underwriting. So I don't think you're supposed to the confusion that there are necessarily lower standards there or a huge systemic problem. And to the extent that we lend to some of these folks who are clients of ours as well as competitors of ours, that lending follows our normal practices. It's often highly secured. And everything we do is in one way or another risky. But I'm not sure that our lending to the NBFI community is an area of risk that we see as more elevated than other areas of risk, I guess, is what I would say.",371,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,22,Jamie Dimon,"Yes. Mike, I would just add that it's a very large category of nonbank financial institutions and probably a number like half of it, we would consider very traditional, not like different. There is a component, which is different today than it was years ago, and there's a component which isn't that different. But if you look at like COs, CLOs and lending to leveraged entities that are underwritten with leveraged loans, so there's kind of a little bit of double leverage in there.

I would say that, yes, there will be additional risk in that category that we will see when we have a downturn. I expect to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be because we don't know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did. Jeremy said these are very smart players. They know what they're doing. They've been around a long time but they're not all very smart. And we don't even know the standards that other banks underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that some of those standards may not be as good as you think. Hopefully, we are very good, though we make our mistakes, too, obviously.

So yes, I think you'd be a little bit worse. We've had a benign credit environment for so long that I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate a little bit more than people think when, in fact, there's a downturn. And hopefully, it will be a fairly normal credit cycle. What always happens is something is worse than a normal credit cycle than a normal downturn. So we'll see. But we think we're quite careful. And obviously, we scour the world looking for things that we should be worried about.

But I do remind people, we've had a bull market for a long time. Asset prices are high, a lot of credit stuff that you would see out there, you will only see when there's a downturn.",334,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,23,Michael Mayo,"And so just a short follow-up after Tricolor, again, this is a real tiny drop in the bucket for you guys but have you gone back and looked at your processes and done anything different?",35,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,24,Jamie Dimon,"Yes. I mean, Michael, you should assume that whenever something happens, we scour all process, all procedures, all underwriting, all everything. And we think we're okay in other stuff. But I -- my antenna goes up when things like that happen. And I probably shouldn't say this but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. And so we should -- everyone should be forewarn on this one. And first brands, I put in the same category. And there are a couple of other ones out that I've seen that I put in similar categories. So -- but we always look at these things, and we're not -- I'm nipping in. We make mistakes, too. So we'll see. There clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things. But that doesn't mean we can't improve our procedures.",142,CEO

2025Q3,October 14 2025,26,Gerard Cassidy,"Jeremy, obviously, you guys are in the residential mortgage lending market, big players granted home lending. When you look at the revenue relative to banking and wealth management, obviously, it's not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be -- when they come out with comments, they follow up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessent has pointed out about a couple of months ago that he thinks there's a housing emergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is, what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the corresponding treasury yield, assuming the treasury yields don't go down. But what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower mortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity, of course, would pick up with that.",151,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,27,Jamie Dimon,"So I'll take that one. First, on the supply side. I mean it's -- we know what it is. It's permitting, it's rules, it's local rules. It's how long it takes to get permits and build not my backyard, you can't build 2 stories in certain places. That's the supply side. The demand side -- and remember, don't always push homeownership. I was -- we made a huge mistake in the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I've been talking about it for years that they should focus on reducing requirements require and we think you reduce the cost of mortgages 30 to 40 basis points overall. without creating any additional risk. There is just excessive stuff put in place after the great financial crisis, which obviously demanded a response but it's excessive. Anyone to take it out a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all these things. So that to me is the most obvious one.

And obviously, government policy, if the government wants to do more FHA, they can do that. But that's up to them about where they want to cheap in mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that. But if they did anything like that, I would say, always do it really thoughtfully.",227,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,28,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good. And as a follow-up, just speaking about regulators in general, there's obviously been a major change with this administration. Can you guys give us any color of what you're actually seeing on the ground. We're, what, 9 months or so into this new administration with the new regulators? And then also any color on when you think Basel III end game may come out and what you're hearing in terms of how it will compare to what the original proposal was in July of '23.",87,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,29,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. Thanks for that, Gerard. So I agree with you. This administration is saying things and from what we're seeing, transitioning to action quite quickly. So what we're seeing from our engagement in Washington, and there's been some reporting in the press recently that's quite comprehensive on the evolution of potential new proposals, which is aligned with what we're hearing as well. But in general, there's a bias for action, getting things done quickly and they're looking at things quite comprehensively from what we see. And as you know, we've argued for a long time, Jamie has argued a lot that this is not about some overall calibration of the system, some like backsolving exercise for some number of whatever type. This is about looking at all the individual components of the capital rules understood holistically, doing the math right and letting that roll up to whatever answer it's going to be.

And by the way, that answer is going to be different for different firms depending on their business mix. And that's okay. And that's part of the reason it doesn't really make sense to kind of try to calibrate to some overall level for the system. It's just like do the math right in a way that makes sense for the individual product or business area or source of risk, and you'll get a reasonable outcome the system. And from what we're hearing, that's very much the direction of travel. The relevant agencies are working well together. There's a sense of urgency. And so we're encouraged.

And I would note actually, back to your first question, that one area where getting things right at the individual product level has relevance is allowing banks to play their appropriate role in the residential mortgage lending market when it -- in the instances where it makes sense, keep those instruments on the balance sheet, you want the capitalization of those to be reasonable and aligned with the risk. And again, from what we understand, that is the direction of travel.

So in terms of timing, I mean, your guess is as good as mine. I think there have been some public comments, and I would just anchor myself on those and the press reporting. But we definitely hear a desire to get things done quickly. And these things are complicated. In some areas, we might have some disagreements at the margin. We'd still dislike G-SIB as a matter of principle. But we don't want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good here and what we're hearing is trending in the right direction.",434,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,30,Jamie Dimon,"Yes. And I just add the Dana number, they are doing that. They're looking at it holistically, that's great. But Dana number is right. I've said for years, G-SIB, CCAR, operational risk capital, double counting of the trading book, I mean it's just wrong. And some of these numbers are so inaccurate that they published that they should publish them with the disclosure saying, we know these are highly inaccurate like the CCAR test. We know that this is not remotely related to reality or stuff like that. So it's almost a dishonest disclosure of these things, like do the actual number.

The second thing they really should do, which I think they're doing is what is the intended effect and what's the unintended effect. So we talk about -- we've gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 public companies. We've gone from pushing mortgages out of the banking system to a huge buildup in parts of the nonbank institutions and a huge amount of arbitrage taking place. I was a regulator, I'd be looking at all that and say, my God, is that what I wanted. And the biggest frustration is they couldn't fixed all these things, reduce liquidity, reduce capital, all these things and made the system safer.

So we had a Silicon Valley Bank blow up because they're so focused on governance, they forgot to focus on interest rate exposure. And they are making changes that, like what is actually real risk banks are bearing as opposed to walk signaling on what a bank should be doing all the time. So hopefully, they'll do it. I think they're devoted to doing it. Like look at their words and their speeches, I'm talking about the OCC, the Fed, the FDIC. So I think it's very good. Let's get it done quickly.",303,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,31,Operator,Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,9,Operator
2025Q3,October 14 2025,32,L. Erika Penala,"My first one is for you, Jeremy. Under the category no good deed goes unpunished. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the expense outlook for '26. You mentioned that $100 billion could be a little low and that you're in the middle of the planning cycle. That would imply 4% growth year-over-year. Is that the sort of new normal labor rate inflation that we should assume at this point?",71,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,33,Jeremy Barnum,"Okay. So yes, a couple of things about that. One is not to get too much into the weeds here but our expenses are a little bit seasonal. So annualizing the fourth quarter, like sometimes you get a bunch of offsets and it's like okay to do that, sometimes it's not. So we always try to do this based on a sort of launch point of the annualized fourth quarter rate. And while that's a reasonable thing to do for NII, it's a lot harder to do for expenses. But taking a step back for a second, I'm not telling you anything that you don't already know, like you can look at whatever ECI or whatever other government measure of labor cost inflation, we know that even while inflation is like a lot lower, we're very far from the moment in the mid-2010s where inflation was, for all intents and purposes, practically 0.

So yes, I think the new normal for labor is some number like that, whatever, 3%, 4%. And it's not just labor, right? I mean, again, I don't want to fail to recognize the extent to which inflation has more or less come back to normal. But by normal, we mean the Fed's target. And for a while, it was below target. So whether it's labor or goods and services, not to get into tariffs or whatever, that's a factor that applies to our entire cost base.

In addition to that, as we noted, we're going to invest where it makes sense. We're going to pay for performance to the extent that there's higher performance and also generally, higher revenues will be associated with other variable expenses. And then overlying all of that is the question of productivity. And it includes but is not limited to AI-driven productivity. So you can assume that we're going to be pushing hard on all fronts to extract as much productivity out of the organization as possible. But as is always true, we're going to try to keep that focus separate from our commitment to invest for growth in the places where we want to.",354,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,34,Jamie Dimon,"And Erika, just add to that, medical, we spent $3 billion or so in medical. That's going to be up 10% next year. And so when you look at some of these things, and we know that already and maybe we think it actually might be up another 10% in 2027 for a whole bunch of different reasons. And that's one thing. The other thing about comp, I just want to point it out, there's normal inflation and pay-for-performance, all that. There's a lot of pressure on -- from other people who are paying people quite well, hedge funds, law firms, private equity, nonbank financial institutions, and we are going to pay our people competitively. That is sine qua non if you want to have a great company for the next 20 years.

And so there's some of that, too. I'm not sure that it's going to change very much when you look at it but I would put in the back of your mind, too. It's probably good for you all to hear me say that. [ It will be true ] for research.",185,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,35,L. Erika Penala,"I'll make sure to send this transcript to my boss. But the second question is actually for you, Jamie. You have always had a differentiated way of thinking about risk and a 2-part question for you. Number one, I feel like we don't even know what the right questions are to ask when it comes to NDFI exposure and risk, which is such a broad category. And so a 2-part question here. Number one, what would be the questions you think investors should ask when assessing NDFI exposure as it relates to future credit risk? And second, should investors be concerned about the SSFA accounting for RWAs in certain structures where you could lower the RWAs to NDFI exposures from 100% to something much lower?",125,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,36,Jamie Dimon,Which SSFA?,2,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,37,Jeremy Barnum,"Got it. I used to know that acronym. It's a technical thing inside securitization where under some conditions, you can lower the RWA weighting.",24,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,38,Jamie Dimon,Is that insurance related.,4,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,39,Jeremy Barnum,"No, it's for us. It's like a part of the rate cap rules. Yes. Do you want me to do that one first and you can do the first one? So even though I don't remember what the -- I think it's like standardized securitization, something, something. I forget what it stands for. But from what I recall about looking at that one, I think it is a mechanism by which you can take otherwise punitive risk weighting for certain types of structures and reduce it from 100 to 20 where arguably 20 is actually probably still too high because you've essentially mitigated the entire risk. So my first [indiscernible] of your question is all the things to worry about, I wouldn't worry about that whatever you want to call it. protection enhancement or risk weighting decrease in that narrow context.

And on your question of like what questions to ask about the NBFI space in general, I mean, Jamie will have his views. But yes, I think it starts by acknowledging that like it's a very, very broad space. And so we probably need to narrow the focus a little bit. Like subprime auto is one thing, lending to like trillion asset is a very different thing. So...",209,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,40,Jamie Dimon,"Maybe we take a crack and tell you a little bit more about it. We feel fairly comfortable with our exposure in that. But I think what you should do is -- I think when we have a downturn, this is the important thing, there will be a credit cycle. And we shouldn't be surprised. The credit card losses go up, middle market loss go up, everything gets worse in a downturn in credit. I do suspect -- I can't prove this, and I don't know because we don't know everyone's underwriting standards. Every now and we see what someone else is doing, we're surprised that their standards are not particularly good, but that's always been true. I suspect when there's a downturn, you will see higher than normal downturn type of credit losses in certain categories. I just suspect that.

And so the other thing, which you can do, which I'm going to ask Mike Grub to do for me because I asked periodically, look at the pricing of BDCs and their publicly traded private credit facilities and do the homework. There are disclosures around that, and we do it. And so maybe we take just a crack at one point, laying out the different carriers of MBFIs and ones that might be concerning and ones that aren't concerning.",220,CEO

2025Q3,October 14 2025,42,James Mitchell,"Maybe just on the investment banking environment. Obviously, things have gotten better. Just curious where you see the most strength in the pipeline. And as we get rate cuts coming, do you feel that we're starting to see more activity pick up or the potential for more activity to pick up among financial sponsors? Just curious your thoughts.",58,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,43,Jeremy Barnum,"Okay. Interesting question on the sponsors. I mean, I don't know. I personally am not persuaded of the notion that cuts coming through that are fully priced in are going to meaningfully change behavior in a sort of highly sophisticated professional community like financial sponsors. If that plays into like flattening of the yield curve for other reasons, et cetera, beyond what's priced in from the forwards, that could be a little bit of a different story. But I think what is clearly true, a little bit to the point of your question is that the environment is -- the results are very robust and the tone is very upbeat.

I think an interesting thing from my perspective is to think about the narrative starting from the beginning of the year, right? We had the moment of -- everyone was talking about animal spirits and a big booming moment. And then we had Liberation Day and all the tariff uncertainty and equity market volatility. And so things kind of went quiet for a while. But what's interesting is that from the IPO perspective, for example, processes were kicked off early in the year. And those processes continued even during the moments where conditions weren't ideal for the deals. And what that meant is that there's a lot of stuff like in the queue that's kind of ready to go. And now conditions are much more favorable, both in terms of equity market valuations, at least until recently, relatively low equity market volatility, a bit more breadth in the rally in terms of multiples, including smaller cap tech sector or whatever.

So yes, that's one area. And in the meantime, as you know, we're starting to see more M&A activity as well. I noted earlier, I think it was the busiest summer we've had in like a long time in terms of announced M&A activity. We're seeing that play through into acquisition finance. I think the rate environment is good enough from the perspective of being able to get deals done. So it's a pretty supportive environment. But as you well know, that can change overnight.",355,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,44,James Mitchell,"Yes. That's all fair. And then maybe just a follow-up on just capital relief and how you're adjusting or at least starting to think about adjusting to that RWA growth that's picking up. Is there other aspects, whether it's in the Markets business or other marginal return activities before that you see opportunities to lean into growth to use up capital because obviously, IRRs on buybacks today at these levels are not great.",73,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,45,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes, exactly. I mean that's the exact math that we're always doing, which is like, okay, subject to certain assumptions, what is the return on a buyback and what's the alternative. Now obviously, we want to be careful there, right? I mean if you take that argument to the extreme and you say like, oh, we want to do every piece of business that's like 1 basis point above the theoretical return on buybacks, you wind up potentially making a lot of really dumb risk decisions. So you want it to be franchise accretive business and you want to recognize that your estimate of the return of that business is itself subject to some uncertainty.

Jamie always says, like putting liquid par assets on the balance sheet and adding leverage is not a thing that actually generates value no matter what the supposed return of that instrument is in the spreadsheet. So it's a thing that we -- it's a thing that we think about a lot. And -- but I would say to the extent that, that's shaping our behavior, it's probably already shaping our behavior because, as you know, we've had the access for quite a while. The price of tangible book multiple has been going up for quite a while. So we're going to continue looking for constructive ways to deploy while making sure that we don't do anything stupid, frankly.",234,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,46,Operator,"Next, we will go to the line of Ken Usdin from Autonomous.",12,Operator
2025Q3,October 14 2025,47,Kenneth Usdin,"I wanted to ask a question about just overall loan yields. I noticed that they were up 3 basis points in the quarter. Obviously, rates hadn't been moving during the quarter and now that we're starting to head back down. Just wondering just what are the main drivers of still being able to actually see higher loan yields.",58,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,48,Jeremy Barnum,"I never look at that. So I have literally no idea why the loan yield is up 3 basis points in the quarter. But if I had to guess, I think it's almost always a function of various types of mix effects, recognizing that we have loans of radically different yields across the company from SOFR plus 20 basis points too. And so relatively small changes in mix can make a big difference. Then obviously, you've got a lot of floating rate instruments all else equal, you would expect those yields to be lower given the cuts that have come in but mix effects can easily overwhelm that. So I'm sure Michael will have a good answer for you by the time the call is over, but I had not looked at that one.",134,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,49,Kenneth Usdin,"Okay. I'll follow up on that. And secondly, with the Sapphire refresh, just assume that we're starting to see some of the awards amortization show in the card fees line and in the card revenue rate. So I'm just wondering if you could kind of walk us through that now that, that card is coming on and you mentioned good additions there. Just what do we have to think about in terms of what leads the horse in terms of card revenue rate and eventual volume growth and related benefits.",90,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,50,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes, it's a good question. So one thing that you might have noticed talking about kind of micro supplement points is that the revenue rate is actually lower than the NII yield, which implies a negative NIR yield. And by the way, that yield is a number that's often quite close to 0. So it doesn't take a lot to make it negative, but it is like currently negative. And while there's a lot of puts and takes inside that number in terms of rewards liability, annual fees and so on, the particular dynamic that's happening now is that as part of the refresh, customers are getting increased value ahead of the moment where the annual fee goes up. So there's a kind of transitional period of a few months as the refresh rolls through where those numbers are slightly elevated.",141,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,51,Jamie Dimon,The fee comes in over a year and some of these rewards come into negative NII over a year.,19,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,52,Jeremy Barnum,Exactly.,1,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,53,Jamie Dimon,It's one example of like really bad accounting.,8,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,54,Jeremy Barnum,"Yes. As that stuff normalizes through, we -- some of these numbers like return to slightly more normal appearance but it might actually take a couple of quarters for that to play out.",33,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,55,Operator,Our last question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW.,9,Operator
2025Q3,October 14 2025,56,Christopher McGratty,"Related to the 15% long-term national retail deposit market share, does your pricing need to be materially different from recent history? Or said another way, do you need to price a little bit more competitive to get that 4 points of improvement over time?",44,Analyst
2025Q3,October 14 2025,57,Jeremy Barnum,"In short, I would say no, unless my CCB colleagues disagree or eventually change their strategy. But I think what you see right now actually from those numbers is you do see us losing a little bit of share in the FDIC recently released results, which have us as #1, which we're happy to celebrate for the fifth year in a row. And the other leading banks or other large banks, which have adopted similar pricing strategies are also seeing a little bit of loss of share. So that is, from our perspective, expected as a conscious result of being disciplined about the pricing of deposits. And it sort of has no particular bearing on the long-term growth strategy to get to 15%, which is all about expansion and deepening and the core value proposition that we offer.

And interestingly, interestingly, when you look inside the granular market-by-market results in that FDIC data, what you see is us actually taking share in a lot of the kind of highest priority, highest profile expansion markets. So in that sense, it's actually a validation of the strategy.

And by the way, I got my answer on the loan yield question. It is mix, including cards. So my guess was correct.",208,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,58,Jamie Dimon,"The retail branch system, as Jeremy said, deepening. But remember, it's better products, better services, more branches and better location, deepening with customer segmentation. If we do a good job in all that, then we hope to gain share. And I think we are doing a good job on that but that -- we have to deliver that for a year to get to 15%.

Folks, thank you very much, for spending time with us. We'll talk to you all soon.",81,CEO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,59,Jeremy Barnum,Thank you.,2,CFO
2025Q3,October 14 2025,60,Operator,"Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",22,Operator
